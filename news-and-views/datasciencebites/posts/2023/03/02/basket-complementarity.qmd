title: "Using ‘basket complementarity’ to make product recommendations"
# description: |
#   Large volumes of data are pouring in every day from scientific experiments, so much so that it is now commonplace to perform dimension reduction in order to reduce a large number of measurements to a set of key values that are easier to visualize and interpret. Enter 'The Sequencer', a proposed method to find trends within high-dimensional datasets.

## About the author
**Moinak Bhaduri**  is assistant professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Bentley University. He studies spatio-temporal Poisson processes and others like the self-exciting Hawkes or log-Gaussian Cox processes that are natural generalizations. His primary interest includes developing change-detection algorithms in systems modeled by these stochastic processes, especially through trend permutations.
