On February 14, 2023, a bipartisan group of US legislators introduced the [Data Science and Literacy Act](https://stevens.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-stevens-leads-bipartisan-legislation-increase-access-data-science-and) with the goal of boosting access to data science education and building “America’s 21st century STEM workforce”. We sat down with guests Zarek Drozda, Anna Bargagliotti, Christine Franklin and Steve Pierson to discuss the news and to hear why data science education is “the new apple pie”.

* Zarek Drozda is director of the [Data Science 4 Everyone](https://www.datascience4everyone.org/about) coalition.
* [Anna Bargagliotti](https://cse.lmu.edu/faculty/?expert=anna.bargagliotti) is graduate program director and professor of mathematics at the Seaver College of Science and Engineering, Loyola Marymount University. 
* Christine Franklin is the American Statistical Association’s [K-12 statistical ambassador](https://www.amstat.org/education/asa-k-12-statistical-ambassador).
