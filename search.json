Audiences are mostly interested in understanding the general use case and the problem-solving process you went through, to see how they might apply the same approach within their own organisations.\nGoals can be defined quite broadly. There’s no expectation that you set out your organisation’s short- or long-term targets. Instead, audiences need to know enough about what you want to do so they can understand what motivates your choice of approach.\nUse toy examples and synthetic data to good effect. We understand that – whether for commercial, legal or ethical reasons – it can be difficult or impossible to share real data in your case studies, or to describe the actual outputs of your work. However, there are many ways to share learnings and insights without divulging sensitive information. This blog post from Lyft uses hypotheticals, mathematical notation and synthetic data to explain the company’s approach to causal forecasting without revealing actual KPIs or data.\nPeople like to experiment, so encourage them to do so. Our platform allows you to embed code and to link that code to interactive coding environments like Google Colab. So if, for example, you want to explain a technique like bootstrapping, why not provide a code block so that audiences can run a bootstrapping simulation themselves.\nLeverage links. You can’t be expected to explain or cover every detail in one case study, so feel free to point audiences to other sources of information that can enrich their understanding: blogs, videos, journal articles, conference papers, etc."

Here’s what this means in practice:\n\nContributors can use data science software and tools to create content – e.g. Visual Studio Code, RStudio, Jupyter Lab; Python, R, Observable, and Shiny – allowing for the full integration of text, code, figures, equations, and other elements.\nReview and editing are transparent and collaborative, again making use of tools data scientists are familiar with – e.g. GitHub, Google Docs – for sharing and revising documents prior to publication.\nContent can be both engaging and interactive. Many data scientists learn by doing, so code can be made available as R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook files to be reused and experimented with offline. Or, the same documents can be used online through tools like Google Colab and Binder. Where appropriate, the use of interactive displays and Shiny apps is encouraged, allowing for data visualisations to be interrogated and regenerated on the fly.\nSite users are contributors too. Through annotation and commenting functionality, site users can interact and converse with authors and other members of the Real World Data Science community. And with all source files hosted on GitHub, users of our site can raise issues, or fork and propose improvements – leading to a true exchange of knowledge."

    "text": "Structure\nThe following outline is a basic guide to structuring an Explainer:\n\n\nHook\n\nIntroduce your topic, and explain why audiences should pay attention. For example, does your Explainer link to one of our published case studies? Does it focus on a tool or method that has been the subject of recent attention? Is it a foundational idea that is relevant to all sorts of data science applications?\n\n\n\nHigh-level summary\n\nA short, largely non-technical explanation of your topic. A good way to view this section is as an accessible condensed version of your complete Explainer. In thinking of it in this way, you can subtly signpost to audiences the areas you’ll be covering and the questions you’ll be answering throughout the remainder of your contribution.\n\n\n\nHistory and background\n\nIt can be useful from a practical perspective to explain how ideas, concepts, tools, and methods have developed over time. Applications may have become more complex in recent years, so exploring the origins of data science techniques might lead you to discover simpler use cases that can help support and illustrate your high-level summary.\n\n\n\nThe how, the when, the why\n\nThis section of your Explainer will likely be split into multiple subsections as you seek to build up your audience’s understanding of your chosen topic. It can be helpful to think about the sorts of questions an audience member might ask and to structure your contribution so that it directly addresses those questions (Q&A/FAQ formats are commonly used in explainer-type articles). If the focus of your Explainer is a data science method, for example, you’ll want to address the following:\n\n\n\nHow does it work and how is it applied (perhaps with an example or simulation)?\nWhat are the underlying assumptions?\nHow is performance checked and assessed?\nHow should outputs be interpreted?\nWhat are the pros and cons, the strengths and limitations of the approach?\nWhat are the optimal use cases, and when should the method be avoided altogether?\nAre there alternatives that people should know about?\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThis serves as your final summary: a chance to remind your audience of what they’ve learned from your Explainer and the main points they should keep in mind.\n\n\n\nTell me more\n\nIt’s sensible to assume that some of your audience will have further questions and will want to learn more about the topic. If you have additional sources of information to recommend, make sure to share them here."

Your Explainer can’t hope to explain everything, so you need to be clear about what’s essential for your audience to know and what isn’t. Make good use of links and references to point audiences to other valuable sources of information that can enrich their understanding of your topic.\nBe clear about your target audience and their expected prior level of knowledge. In keeping with the point above, you need to be clear in your own mind about how much you expect your audience to know already about the general topic or subject matter. You can then structure your contribution accordingly. It might also be helpful to state explicitly, at the outset of your contribution, what assumptions you’ve made about your audience and highlight any background reading that might be beneficial.\nPlan out your route. To help you decide what to cover in your Explainer, we recommend first writing out your high-level summary of the topic and also your key takeaways. This provides you with a start point (A) and an end point (B) for your contribution. The challenge then is to figure out the main points or questions you will need to address to help your audience progress from point A to point B in a way that’s logical and intuitive for them to follow."

You should also say something about yourself and your background, too. This will give additional context to the recommendations you are making.\n\n\n\nList of sources\n\nAs well as naming your sources and telling people how to find them, you should also explain why you are recommending them, how they helped you in your career or studies, or other reasons why you find them to be of value. Sample quotes or small excerpts from the sources themselves might also be worth including.\n\n\n\nStart a dialogue\n\nConclude with a call for readers to share recommendations of their own, either in the article comments or on social media. Contributors are welcome to update their lists any time with new sources, including those suggested by site users.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\nUnlike the feeds described above, each submitted review should focus only on a single publication. It must be an honest summary of the reviewer’s thoughts, feelings and impressions, covering what they liked and didn’t like, the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the publication, and whether it is likely to be of interest and value to its intended audience. Reviews should of course provide an overview of the publication in question but must avoid dry, itemised descriptions of the publication’s constituent parts (e.g., listing out the chapters in a book).\nAll reviews should list the following information (if relevant):\n\nTitle of publication\nAuthor(s)\nDate of publication\nEdition or format used for review\nPublisher\nLength\nPrice\nWebsite address or other source of further information"

    "text": "Structure\nEach contribution must, in effect, tell “a story”, and so contributors need to be clear (a) what their story is, (b) why people should be interested, and (c) what its main message or key takeaways are. To help figure this out, we recommend contributors apply the XY Story Formula.\n\n\nTechnical content and jargon\nTechnical content is a necessary feature of a site like ours. Without it, an article or other piece of content may be of little practical use to a technical audience. But if there’s too much of it, even experts may struggle to stay engaged. Contributors are also faced with a dilemma when it comes to explaining technical content: explain nothing, and you risk alienating some of your audience; explain everything, and you’ll struggle to establish a clear, strong narrative thread. So, careful consideration is required:\n\nWho is my audience for this article?\nWhat is this audience likely to know already, and what needs to be explained?\nIf something needs to be explained, can I do so briefly and then link to other resources? Or is a full explanation required?\nIn telling my “story”, what are the absolute-need-to-knows, and what are the simply-nice-to-knows?\n\nThinking through these questions will help contributors to find the right mix of valuable, technical content paired with accessible, readable narrative.\nKeep in mind that the same general advice applies to the use of industry jargon. Jargon can be a valuable shorthand when communicating with people working in the same organisation or sector, but those working in different fields may struggle to make sense of it. So, contributors need to think carefully about how much jargon to use, and what needs to be explained.\n\n\nFigures/graphics\nAll data visualisations and other graphical outputs directly related to the content of submissions must be presented neatly and cleanly (avoid chart junk). They should also be labelled correctly and legibly, with colours chosen carefully to ensure they can be easily distinguished by all readers. Accompanying captions must be written to support the reader’s understanding of the visual presentation (e.g., “Figure 1: a bar chart” is an insufficient description).\nIf contributors wish to use charts or graphs that are not their own work, they must ensure that such items are correctly sourced and referenced, and that permission to republish has been obtained. A letter or email confirming this permission is required.\n\n\nData sources\nContributors must include within their submissions any links and/or references to the sources of data, code and/or software and software packages on which their analyses are based. We understand that some data sources may not be publicly available, whether for legal, ethical or commercial reasons. However, readers must still be told where the data come from, even if they are not able to access the data themselves.\n\n\nReferences\nCitations are to be formatted in The Chicago Manual of Style author-date format.\n\n\nUse of images\nImages for general illustration purposes will be sourced and – where necessary and within reason – paid for by Real World Data Science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor all other style-related matters, we follow The Guardian and Observer Style Guide."
