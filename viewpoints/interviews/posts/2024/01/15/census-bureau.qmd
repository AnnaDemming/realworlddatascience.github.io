A month ago now, Real World Data Science published [an interview with UK national statistician Professor Sir Ian Diamond](https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/12/15/ian-diamond.html). In the process of preparing the text of that interview for publication, I found myself reflecting on a conversation I'd been part of earlier in the year with Robert Santos, director of the US Census Bureau.

I met Santos in Toronto, Canada, in August -- a few hours before his [President's Invited Address at the 2023 Joint Statistical Meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmljZLfqIbI). The meeting was arranged as a joint interview with Anna Britten, editor of our sister publication *Significance* magazine, and Santos was joined by Sallie Ann Keller, the Census Bureau's chief scientist and associate director for research and methodology, and Michael Hawes, senior advisor for data access and privacy.

The interview with Santos, Keller, and Hawes was published in [the October issue of *Significance*](https://academic.oup.com/jrssig/article/20/5/40/7296065), so you may have already read it. But, following on from our Sir Ian Diamond interview, I thought it worth highlighting some of what Santos *et al.* had to say, particularly where key themes, challenges, and opportunities seem to resonate across both the US Census Bureau and the UK Office for National Statistics. 

I've also gone back to the original interview recording to pick out some previously unpublished comments.
