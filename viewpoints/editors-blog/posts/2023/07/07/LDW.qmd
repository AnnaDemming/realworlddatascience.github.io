# description: |
#   A new survey from the Ada Lovelace Institute and the Alan Turing Institute finds broadly positive views towards AI use cases in healthcare and border security, among others, but people are also concerned about the dangers of overreliance on the technologies and a lack of clarity around accountability.

[London Data Week](https://www.londondataweek.org/) wraps up on Sunday, and what a week it's been! Kudos to organisers [Sam Nutt and Jennifer Ding](https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/06/08/london-data-week.html) for the huge amount of energy and passion they invested in making this idea a reality, and I'm looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us next year.

My highlights of the week? Well, of course, I really enjoyed being part of the event that was hosted at the Royal Statistical Society on Tuesday. The [Statisticians for Society](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/) workshop brought together charities and statisticians to explore ways in which data and statistics can support third sector organisations to deliver on their charitable aims as well as demonstrate the impact they are having to their communities and funders. There's a nice selection of [case studies of successful past projects on the RSS website](https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/case-studies/), and hopefully the London Data Week event will result in several new additions to this collection in due course.

I wasn't able to attend this event myself, but I'm really looking forward to seeing the outputs of the [Better Images of AI](https://betterimagesofai.org/images) Workshop, which was also held on Tuesday. Real World Data Science has incorporated several of the group's images in past articles ([here](https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2022/11/23/LLM-content-warning.html#qa), [here](https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/06/05/no-AI-probably-wont-kill-us.html) and [here](https://realworlddatascience.net/ideas/posts/2023/07/03/trusted-AI.html)), so I'm excited to see what gets added to the image gallery in the coming weeks.

Sticking with the AI theme, I also got to explore the ["AI: Who's Looking After Me?" exhibition](https://london.sciencegallery.com/ai-season) at the Science Gallery, where I found myself unexpectedly moved by one particular installation -- an artificial landfill of broken and discarded tablets and smart speakers, explaining matter-of-factly, but with a underlining sense of mournfulness, that they had been "replaced by a newer model that is better because it is lighter, or heavier, or bigger, or smaller...". Fortunately I was able to cheer myself up with another exhibit, which asked you to teach a chatbot all about love.

Later that same day (which was actually last Thursday, before London Data Week officially began), I then listened in to a panel debate on "Building Better AI in the Open", featuring Margaret Mitchell of HuggingFace, Lara Groves of the Ada Lovelace Institute, and Irini Papadimitriou of FutureEverything, facilitated by artist and machine learning design researcher Caroline Sinders. A recording of the panel is below, and well worth a watch for thoughts on ...

(Jennifer Ding also followed up the panel with [a thoughtful post on the benefits of open source AI](https://loti.london/blog/building-better-ai-in-the-open/).)
