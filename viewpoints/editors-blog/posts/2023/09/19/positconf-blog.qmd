### From data confusion to data intelligence
An inspiring start to posit::conf(2023) this morning, with keynote talks from Elaine McVey, senior director of analytics at Chief, and David Meza, head of analytics for human capital at NASA, sharing stories and insights on how to build strong data science foundations in organisations.

McVey spoke about the frequent mismatch between high levels of hope for what data science can achieve within organisations, and low levels of understanding about how to set up data science teams for success. The best chance for success, she said, is if data scientists take the lead in helping organisations learn how to make best use of data science expertise.

From there, McVey went on to present a set of "guerilla data science tactics" that data scientists can use to get around any obstacles they may encounter, as illustrated in the slide below:

Start by 'scanning for opportunities', then 'show, don't tell', 'take the data and run', 'nail the landing', and 'up the ante'."}

Data scientists should start by scanning for opportunities to help the organisation, before building a small-scale version of what it is they propose to do. Once buy-in is achieved, and data is made available, it's time to run with the project. Once complete, you need to "nail the landing", McVey said, and make sure to communicate results broadly -- not just to primary stakeholders, but across the organisation. Then comes time to "up the ante": if your first project has built some organisational goodwill, leverage that and look for something higher risk, with higher potential reward for the organisation.

Throughout this process, McVey said, data scientists should be building foundations for future projects -- creating data pipelines, R packages, etc., that can be reused later. This was a point picked up and developed upon by Meza, who walked through in detail the steps required to establish "data foundations" within organisations, drawing on his own past experiences. Typically, he said, organisations seem to collect data just to store it -- but always data should be collected, stored, and managed with analysis in mind.

### A hacker's guide to open source LLMs
Fast.ai's Jeremy Howard lifted the hood on large language models (LLMs) in the second of two keynotes this morning. 

Beginning with an accessible overview of what LLMs are, how they work, and how they are trained, Howard then addressed some of the criticisms made of LLMs -- that they "can't reason" or give correct answers.

As Howard explained, a model like OpenAI's GPT-4 is not trained at any point to give correct answers to prompts -- only to predict the most likely next word, or word token, in a sequence. 

The pre-training step, for example, does not involve only feeding the model with "correct answers", instead relying on a corpus of text from the internet -- some (or, maybe, much) of which may consist of factual inaccuracies, errors, falsehoods, etc. And in the fine-tuning stage, when human feedback is used to either reward or penalise model outputs, Howard said there is a preference for confident-sounding responses -- and so, again, this doesn't necessarily reward the model for giving correct answers.

Howard made the case that users have to help language models to give good answers, and that custom instructions can be used to change the way models respond. He then walked delegates through a series of demos using open-source LLMs, to show how outputs can be refined and improved.

"My view is that if you are going to be good at language modelling in any way," said Howard, "you have to be good at using language models."

### Documenting Things: Openly for Future Us
Julia Stewart Lowndes, founding director of [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org/), gave a compelling talk advocating for the importance of documentation for data science projects.

Documenting things, Lowndes said, should be done for the benefit of "Future Us": not only ourselves but our teams and our communities who may be contributing to or revisiting the project in the next hours, days, weeks, months and years.

Documenting things does not have to be painful, Lowndes said. In fact, it's supposed to be helpful. It does, however, take time and intention. And it means slowing down briefly to write things down now, in order that work speeds up in the longer term.

Lowndes then shared some pointers to help people get started with documentation:

1. Have a place to write things down -- Google Docs, GitHub, wherever -- ideally a place where people can work collaboratively.
    i) Develop the habit of writing things down as you go.
    ii) Write in a modular way -- small bits of text are less daunting and easier to maintain collaboratively.
2. Have an audience in mind -- you are writing this for someone, so make it engaging for them.
    i) write in an inclusive tone. 
    ii) Narrate code in small chunks, and in a way that you'd say out loud if teaching.
    iii) Share, and share early -- you want to be able to iterate on your documentation and receive feedback. Also, sharing openly does not always mean publicly -- manage permissions as necessary.
3. Design for readability and accessibility. 
    i) Use section headers -- particularly important for screen readers, but this also helps generally to describe the flow of a document. Plus, you can link readers directly to specific parts of a document.
    ii) Use text formatting.
    iii) Use alt-text for images, describing the take-home message of the image.

### Teaching Data Science in Adverse Circumstances: Posit Cloud and Quarto to the Rescue
Professor Aleksander Dietrichson of the Universidad de San Martin brought a valuable perspective to posit::conf(2023) on the challenges of teaching data science in the face of technology and language barriers.

At the public, state-funded university in Argentina where Dietrichson works, more than half of students do not have access to laptops or computers at home, and those who do have access -- whether at home or at school -- may not have access to the latest kit. But "[Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) solves the resource issue", Dietrichson said. The free-to-use, online browser-based version of Posit's tools runs on anything; Dietrichson said he's tested it successfully on both decade-old computers and cellphones -- though he doesn't recommend using it on a cellphone!

On language barriers, he pointed out that learning to code in R and Python can be challenging when English isn't your first language -- if you don't have semantic access to function names, for example, there will be a steeper learning curve for students.

Dietrichson also has to deal with the problem of "arithmaphobia" among some of the liberal arts students he teaches. This has necessitated a reshuffling of the typical statistics curriculum, he said, in order to make it easier for students to access. But the work is worth it, Dietrichson explained: many of his students want to work in careers like journalism, and he believes that "journalists should be statistically literate".
