### From data confusion to data intelligence
An inspiring start to posit::conf(2023) this morning, with keynote talks from Elaine McVey, senior director of analytics at Chief, and David Meza, head of analytics for human capital at NASA, sharing stories and insights on how to build strong data science foundations in organisations.

McVey spoke about the frequent mismatch between high levels of hope for what data science can achieve within organisations, and low levels of understanding about how to set up data science teams for success. The best chance for success, she said, is if data scientists take the lead in helping organisations learn how to make best use of data science expertise.

From there, McVey went on to present a set of "guerilla data science tactics" that data scientists can use to get around any obstacles they may encounter, as illustrated in the slide below:

Start by 'scanning for opportunities', then 'show, don't tell', 'take the data and run', 'nail the landing', and 'up the ante'."}

Data scientists should start by scanning for opportunities to help the organisation, before building a small-scale version of what it is they propose to do. Once buy-in is achieved, and data is made available, it's time to run with the project. Once complete, you need to "nail the landing", McVey said, and make sure to communicate results broadly -- not just to primary stakeholders, but across the organisation. Then comes time to "up the ante": if your first project has build some organisational goodwill, leverage that and look for something higher risk, with higher potential reward for the organisation.

Throughout this process, McVey said, data scientists should be building foundations for future projects -- creating data pipelines, R packages, etc., that can be reused later. This was a point picked up and developed upon by Meza, who walked through in detail the steps required to establish "data foundations" within organisations, drawing on his own past experiences. Typically, he said, organisations collect data to store it -- but always data should be collected and managed with analysis in mind.
