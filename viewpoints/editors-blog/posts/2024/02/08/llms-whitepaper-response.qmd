The UK government this week announced a £10 million investment to "jumpstart regulators' AI capabilities" as part of its commitment to a "pro-innovation approach to AI regulation." But will this be sufficient to answer criticisms that it has so far been "too slow" to give regulators the tools to police the growing usage of AI?

In March last year, the government set out its [principles- and context-based approach to regulating artificial intelligence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper), which proposed to focus on "the context in which AI is deployed" rather than target specific technologies. Under this model, existing regulators, including the Information Commissioners Office, Ofcom, and the Competition and Markets Authority, would be responsible for ensuring that technologies deployed within their domains adhered to a common set of principles:

- Safety, security and robustness.
- Appropriate transparency and explainability.
- Fairness.
- Accountability and governance.
- Contestability and redress.

This approach was broadly well-received, as was clear from a debate at techUK's [Digital Ethics Summit](https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/12/08/digital-ethics-summit.html) last December. However, concerns were expressed about whether regulators would be funded sufficiently to meet the expectations set out in the March whitepaper. And the Royal Statistical Society, in [its response to the whitepaper](https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/2023/RSS-AI-white-paper-response-v2-2.pdf), worried that "splitting responsibilities for regulating the use of AI between existing regulators does not meet the scale of the challenge," and that "central leadership is required to give a clear, coherent and easily communicable framework that can be applied to all sectors."

While the government whitepaper did propose that a range of "central functions" be created to support regulators, [evidence presented to a House of Lords inquiry](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/170/communications-and-digital-committee/news/199728/uk-will-miss-ai-goldrush-unless-government-adopts-a-more-positive-vision/) last November found that regulators "did not appear to know what was happening" with these teams and that they were "keen to see progress."

In reporting the outcomes of this inquiry, the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee concluded that government was being "too slow" to give regulators the tools they needed to meet the whitepaper objectives, and that "speedier resourcing of government‑led
central support teams is needed." 

"Relying on existing regulators to ensure good outcomes from AI will only work if they are properly resourced and empowered," the committee said. So, the £10 million funding for regulators announced this work is likely to be welcomed. Money is earmarked to "help regulators develop cutting-edge research and practical tools to monitor and address risks and opportunities in their sectors, from telecoms and healthcare to finance and education," according to [a press release from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-signals-step-change-for-regulators-to-strengthen-ai-leadership).
