title: "Large language models: Do we need to understand the maths, or simply recognise the limitations?"
description: |
  Do we need to understand the inner workings of large language models before we use them? Or, is it enough to simply teach people to recognise that model outputs can't always be relied upon, and that some use cases are better than others? Members of the Royal Statistical Society’s Data Science and AI Section discuss these and other questions in part two of our Q&A.
