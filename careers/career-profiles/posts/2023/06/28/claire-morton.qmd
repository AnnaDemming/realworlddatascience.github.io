This week, in celebration of Pride, Real World Data Science is collaborating with the [JEDI Organizing Group](https://datascijedi.org/) of the [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/) (ASA) and the [ASA LGBTQ+ Advocacy Committee](https://sites.google.com/view/asa-lgbtq/home) to highlight the achievements of statisticians and data scientists from across the LGBTQ+ spectrum.

Members of the committee nominated two individuals to be featured as part of our [career profile](https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/career-profiles/) series, and so we're pleased to bring you interviews with Claire Morton (below) and [Albert Lee](albert-lee.qmd).

Read on to discover more about Claire's data science career (so far).
