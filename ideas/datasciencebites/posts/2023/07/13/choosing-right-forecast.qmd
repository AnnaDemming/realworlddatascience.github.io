title: "Choosing the right forecast"
# description: |
#   Purchase suggestions -- e.g., "if you are buying that, you might also want this" -- are, to a large extent, informed by the concept of complementarity: that certain products are often bought and/or used together. A journal paper by Puka and Jedrusik sheds light on how these product recommendations can be derived, as Moinak Bhaduri explains.
