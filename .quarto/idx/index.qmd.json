This site and its content are being created and curated by data science practitioners and leaders with a single goal in mind: to help you deliver high quality, ethical, impactful data science in your workplace.\n\nReal World Data Science aims to be a trusted, go-to source for high-quality, engaging and inspiring content which helps data science students, practitioners and leaders to: \n\n* discover and learn more efficiently;  \n* acquire practical problem-solving skills;  \n* share their knowledge and accomplishments publicly;  \n* work smarter, ethically, and more effectively.  \n\n## What will we provide?\nResources will be *created* to meet the needs of our target audiences. These include: \n\n* **Case studies** – showing how data science is used to solve real-world problems in business, public policy and beyond. \n* **Exercises** – to challenge and develop the analytical mindset that all data scientists need to succeed. \n* **Explainers** – interrogating the underlying assumptions and limitations of data science tools and methods, to help data scientists make smarter, more informed analytical choices.   \n* **Advice** – interviews, Q&As, and FAQs on such topics as data science ethics, career paths, and communication, to support professional development. \n\nResources will also be *curated* to help data scientists identify trustworthy, high-quality content. These include: \n\n* **Training guides** – step-by-step approaches and recommended sources for learning new skills and methods. \n* **Datasets** – tagged and sorted to help educators and practitioners find data to meet their teaching and training needs. \n* **Feeds** – who and what to follow to keep up with new ideas and developments.\n\n## How you can get involved\nSee our open [call for contributions](contributor-docs/call-for-contributions.qmd)."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"flatly","title":"A showcase for data science in action","sidebar":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
