  <title>Choosing the right forecast</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Nobel laureate Niels Bohr is famously quoted as saying, “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.” The science (or perhaps the art) of forecasting is no easy task and lends itself to a large amount of uncertainty. For this reason, practitioners interested in prediction have increasingly migrated to probabilistic forecasting, where an entire distribution is given as the forecast instead of a single number, thus fully quantifying the inherent uncertainty. In such a setting, traditional metrics of assessing and comparing predictive performance, such as mean squared error (MSE), are no longer appropriate. Instead, proper scoring rules are utilized to evaluate and rank forecast methods. A scoring rule is a function that takes a predictive distribution along with an observed value and outputs a real number called the score. Such a rule is said to be proper if the expected score is maximized when the predictive distribution is the same as the distribution from which the observation was drawn.</p>
<p>Many proper scoring rules exist, such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the logarithmic score. Choosing which rule to use is not necessarily straightforward. Furthermore, forecast methods are often selected not based on a single score, but rather averages of scores from many probabilistic forecasts, which can introduce new challenges affecting how one might rank competing forecasts. In the paper under discussion, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-38/issue-1/Local-scale-invariance-and-robustness-of-proper-scoring-rules/10.1214/22-STS864.short">Bolin and Wallin</a> define several properties of scoring rules that help clarify how the rules behave when multiple forecast scores are averaged. Additionally, they introduce a new class of proper rules that aims to overcome some of the deficiencies of other common scoring rules.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Local scale invariance and robustness of proper scoring rules</p>
<p><strong>Author(s) and year:</strong> David Bolin and Jonas Wallin (2023)</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Published in <em>Statistical Science</em>, DOI: <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-38/issue-1/Local-scale-invariance-and-robustness-of-proper-scoring-rules/10.1214/22-STS864.short">10.1214/22-STS864</a>.</p>

<p>The authors argue that situations are often encountered where forecasts are derived and subsequently averaged for observations with different inherent variability. One example might be financial data, such as stock returns, where there are commonly periods with much higher variance (known as volatility in the financial setting). Such processes can be represented using a model known as stochastic volatility, where the variance of observed data evolves randomly over time. Figure 1 plots an example path of the data-generating process under such a model. When data exhibits this varying uncertainty, many proper scoring rules will assign a score whose magnitude changes for those observations with more variability, a characteristic the authors term scale dependence. Some rules will ‘punish’ observations with higher uncertainty, and others may ‘reward’ such observations. Hence, when averaging multiple scores, observations will not be treated symmetrically, which the authors argue can “lead to unintuitive forecast rankings.”</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Left, a time series of volatility, and right, the resulting observations under a standard stochastic volatility model.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, an ideal scoring rule will not suffer from scale dependence. The lack of scale dependence is a property that the authors term local scale invariance. The logarithmic score possesses this attribute, but the CRPS and other scoring rules, like the Hyvärinen score, do not. To address this issue, the authors propose a new class of scoring rules which exhibits local scale invariance. Among this class is a scoring rule dubbed the scaled CRPS (SCRPS), which features many of the desirable qualities of the CRPS but overcomes the scale dependence issue.</p>
<p>Of course, if local scale invariance is all that matters, then we could just use the logarithmic score in all scenarios. But there is another issue to consider when averaging forecast scores – the presence of outliers. In many scenarios, we might encounter observations that are very far outside the normal range, and we don’t want our average forecast performance measure to be greatly thrown off if such an oddity is observed. In other words, we want our proper scoring rules to be robust. In their article, Bolin and Wallin formalize the concept of robustness for scoring rules and show that, in many cases, the logarithmic score is not robust. Yet they also prove their proposed class of scaled scoring rules is not generally robust, although they show that the scoring rules can be modified to be robust (a new scoring rule they term robust SCRPS). Under such a modification, however, the scoring rule would no longer be local scale invariant in the strict sense. Indeed, under the proposed definitions of local scale invariance and robustness, finding a scoring rule that can simultaneously satisfy both criteria seems difficult. The authors conjecture that it may even be impossible.</p>
<p>Hence, this paper raises many questions for future consideration but achieves its goal of showing that evaluating probabilistic forecasts by averaging proper scoring rules is not necessarily a simple matter. Different scoring rules will lead to different rankings of forecasting methods, and the underlying properties of each scoring rule must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Although not discussed in this summary, the authors also compare scoring rules in several scenarios and present the theory behind the ideas examined here.

  <title>Teaching a chatbot about love, and other adventures from London Data Week</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://www.londondataweek.org/">London Data Week</a> wraps up on Sunday, and what a week it’s been! Kudos to organisers <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/06/08/london-data-week.html">Sam Nutt and Jennifer Ding</a> for the huge amount of energy and passion they invested in making this idea a reality, and I’m looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us next year.</p>
<p>My highlights of the week? Well, of course, I really enjoyed being part of the event that was hosted at the Royal Statistical Society on Tuesday. The <a href="https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/">Statisticians for Society</a> workshop brought together charities and statisticians to explore ways in which data and statistics can support third sector organisations to deliver on their charitable aims as well as demonstrate to communities and funders the impact they are having. There’s a nice selection of <a href="https://rss.org.uk/membership/volunteering-and-promoting/statisticians-for-society-initiative/case-studies/">case studies of successful past projects on the RSS website</a>, and hopefully the London Data Week event will result in several new additions to this collection in due course.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to attend this event myself, but I’m really looking forward to viewing the outputs of the <a href="https://betterimagesofai.org/images">Better Images of AI</a> workshop, which was also held on Tuesday. Real World Data Science has used several of the group’s images to illustrate past articles (<a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2022/11/23/LLM-content-warning.html#qa">here</a>, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/06/05/no-AI-probably-wont-kill-us.html">here</a> and <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/ideas/posts/2023/07/03/trusted-AI.html">here</a>), so I’m excited to see what gets added to the image gallery in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Sticking with the AI theme, I also got to explore the <a href="https://london.sciencegallery.com/ai-season">“AI: Who’s Looking After Me?” exhibition</a> at the Science Gallery, where I found myself unexpectedly moved by one installation in particular – <a href="https://london.sciencegallery.com/ai-artworks/newly-forgotten-technologies">an artificial landfill of broken and discarded tablets and smart speakers</a>, explaining matter-of-factly, but with an unmistakable air of mournfulness, that they had been replaced “by a newer model that is better because it is lighter, or heavier, or bigger, or smaller…”. Fortunately I was able to cheer myself up with another exhibit, which tasks visitors with <a href="https://london.sciencegallery.com/ai-artworks/looking-for-love">helping a chatbot to define and understand love</a>.</p>
<p>Later on in my visit to the Science Gallery (which was actually last Thursday, before London Data Week officially began), I listened to a panel debate on “Building Better AI in the Open”, featuring Margaret Mitchell of HuggingFace, Lara Groves of the Ada Lovelace Institute, and Irini Papadimitriou of FutureEverything, facilitated by artist and machine learning design researcher Caroline Sinders. A recording of the panel is below, and well worth a watch for discussion of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the advantages of open source versus closed source</li>
<li>the role of public participation in AI</li>
<li>what transparency in AI development should look like</li>
<li>issues of accountability in AI applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jennifer Ding followed up the panel with <a href="https://loti.london/blog/building-better-ai-in-the-open/">a thoughtful post on the benefits of open source AI</a>, and for more on trustworthy AI – and the need for transparency, explainability, and fairness – check out Maxine Setiawan and Mira Pijselman’s recent Real World Data Science article, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/ideas/posts/2023/07/03/trusted-AI.html">“Trusted AI: translating AI ethics from theory into practice”</a>.</p>

  <title>Trusted AI: translating AI ethics from theory into practice</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>With artificial intelligence (AI) becoming increasingly prevalent across sectors, so too have conversations about AI ethics. AI ethics provides a repeatable and comprehensive way to assess what we should and should not be doing with AI, and sets out how we ought to design, use, and govern AI products in accordance with key principles. Ethical frameworks are essential to derive sustainable value from AI products and services and build trust.</p>
<p>A myriad of AI tools that leverage automated or semi-automated decision-making processes have raised important questions that have become foundational in the AI ethics community, such as ‘What does it mean for an algorithm to be fair?’ As an example, AI tools that are used in recruitment may perpetuate biases arising from historical training data. If a model used to generate a shortlist of applicants has been trained on data from past candidates, say, and those candidates – both successful and unsuccessful – are predominantly men, historical patterns that contain various biases will perpetuate to become algorithmic biases that form the model’s decisions. Thus, the model may algorithmically discriminate against women or gender minorities, as individuals from these groups are not well represented in the training data.</p>
<p>To ensure the safe and responsible use of AI, the focus moving forward needs to be on the operationalisation of AI ethics into the day-to-day development lifecycle. But, what does this look like in practice? And how might you get started as an ethical AI practitioner? In this article, we unpack these questions and give you, the data scientist, a foundation to begin your journey towards trusted AI. Read along to get an overview of key principles that you should be aware of, what they mean, their underlying technical grounding, and what implementation might look like practically.</p>
<section id="ethical-ai-principles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethical-ai-principles">Ethical AI principles</h2>
<p>You have likely heard of several principles in relation to ethical AI, such as fairness or transparency. The context in which you’ve encountered such principles is most probably due to their inclusion in a broader ethical framework. Some of the most popular ethical AI frameworks include the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework-2020">UK Data Ethics Framework</a>, and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai">European Commission’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI</a>. Among these and many other frameworks, we can run into what <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3831321">Floridi and Cowls (2019)</a> call “principle proliferation,” whereby it becomes overwhelming for those contributing to AI programmes to know where to begin with ethics due to an excess of choice (p.&nbsp;2).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there is no single universally accepted standard that dictates which essential ethical AI values or principles should be adhered to during AI development and deployment. However, there are common themes that emerge. In our organisation, EY, we’ve learned from the variety of principles, frameworks, and white papers in the AI ethics community and developed our own Trusted AI Framework comprising five key attributes that we believe assure the trustworthiness of AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transparent</li>
<li>Explainable</li>
<li>Unbiased</li>
<li>Resilient</li>
<li>High-performing</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, we take a deeper dive into the first three attributes – transparency, explainability, and unbiasedness (or fairness). These are areas where data scientists can act as critical enablers of ethical AI when they have the right knowledge and toolkits at their disposal.</p>
<section id="transparency" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
<p>Transparency is the ability to provide meaningful information to foster awareness and understanding of an AI system. It starts with documenting AI systems in a way that is accessible for a broad audience with a spectrum of technical abilities. It is a simple yet powerful way to build trust in AI. It empowers non-technical stakeholders to critically evaluate AI development decisions, thereby unlocking multi-disciplinary insights that can mitigate reputational or performance risks. Further, it also builds trust with society, as it can enable everyday users to interrogate AI design decisions, product capabilities, and system limitations, thereby permitting users to make informed judgements about technology. Unfortunately, transparency is often misunderstood as disclosing trade secrets or proprietary information, such as source code and datasets. However, transparency can be achieved without disclosing such technically complex information. Instead, it can be as simple as disclosing where and when an AI system is being used, or for what purposes a model should be employed.</p>
<p>But what exactly does “documenting AI systems” look like? Documentation should consist of a mix of technical components (system architecture, dataset selection determination, model selection techniques, etc.) and non-technical components (business case, product purpose of use, alignment to overall AI strategy, etc.). The research community has recommended AI documentation standards, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf">datasheets for datasets</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf">model cards for model reporting</a>. You can liken datasheets or model cards to the importance placed upon commenting your code – the more information there is available around decisions throughout model development, the greater the certainty that these artefacts will be understood and used as intended moving forward. Proper documentation and governance will help ensure accountability, improve internal and external oversight, and initiate discussions around model optimisation goals and their trade-offs, such as including fairness and accuracy in optimisation objectives.</p>
<p>With upcoming AI regulations, transparency requirements will become more integral. For example, the <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">European Union (EU) AI Act</a> introduces specific transparency obligations, such as bot disclosures, for both users and providers of AI systems, which would allow users to opt out of interacting with an AI system. Furthermore, in higher risk use cases, specific technical documentation is needed, which would include details of a system’s intended purpose and descriptions of its development process.</p>
</section>
<section id="explainability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="explainability">Explainability</h3>
<p>Once transparency is enabled, explainability is a natural next step, especially when an AI product is implemented in a more regulated or high-risk environment. Explainability is the ability to express why an AI system reached a particular decision or understand the features that affect model behaviour. Explainability is a key concern within the field of explainable AI, which, as a discipline, strives to improve trustworthiness by enabling a better understanding of a system’s underlying logic via a suite of technical methods.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, different model architectures mean that some models are more interpretable than others, as the steps used to evaluate their predictions are easier for humans to comprehend. Decision trees, for example, have more human-interpretable characteristics than deep learning models. Different model architectures also mean that there are interpretation tools that are only applicable to certain models, such as regression weights in a linear model.</p>
<p>Another approach to consider, then, is model-agnostic interpretation, which encompasses both global interpretability (explanation of an entire model’s behaviour) and local interpretability (explanation of a single prediction). While there are fast-developing techniques and tools for model-agnostic interpretability, let’s take a look at two of the more popular methods available:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939778">Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME)</a></dt>
<dd>
This is an explanation technique that trains local surrogate models, using explainable models such as Lasso or decision trees, to approximate the predictions of a model that is not interpretable by design in order to explain individual model predictions. The idea is to use interpretable features from the surrogate models to create human-friendly explanations where the underlying model cannot. For example, in an image classification model that detects a flower in an image, LIME is able to highlight the parts of the image that explain why the model classifies the image as a flower (see illustration below). This provides an interpretable explanation between the input variable and prediction, which is an essential part of interpretability.

In this example, an image classification system receives an image of a sunflower and classifies it as a flower with 70% likelihood. The LIME approach then sees parts of the input image perturbed, or masked, leading to different classification likelihoods from the AI system. From this, a model is able to determine the parts of the input image that best explain the initial classification of 'flower'."></a></p>

<dd>
SHAP (<a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">GitHub repo</a>) uses tools and theoretical foundations from game theory, one of which is Shapley values. It works by assigning each feature an importance value for a particular prediction to numerically explain the contribution of various features to a model’s output. For example, in a model that predicts flu, SHAP calculates the importance of sneezing as a feature by removing and adding the subset of other features, leading to different combinations of features that contribute to the prediction. This method provides interpretable solutions for more complex models similar to the equivalent of “weights” in linear models.

<section id="fairness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fairness">Fairness</h3>
<p>The area of AI ethics that is central to impending AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act and the New York City AI Law,<sup>1</sup> is fairness. AI models are inherently biased because of their underlying training data.<sup>2</sup> Thus, when we speak of fairness in the context of AI ethics, we are referring to a combination of technical and non-technical ways to minimise the impacts of algorithmic bias.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the technical approaches to fairness. To achieve equitable, reliable, and fair decisions, a diverse and balanced set of examples is needed in training datasets. However, data often contains disparities that, if left unchecked, can perpetuate algorithmic biases and harms. There are various approaches to detect sources of bias, guarantee fairness, or “debias” models. To strive for algorithmic fairness, many papers have proposed various quantitative measures of fairness, with some based on unstated assumptions about fairness in society. Unfortunately, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07236.pdf">these assumptions are often mutually incompatible</a>, making it difficult to compare fairness metrics to one another – consider, for example, the longstanding debate between equality of outcome and equality of treatment.</p>
<p>Although metrics incompatibilities exist, fairness broadly focuses on equality of opportunity (group fairness), and equality of outcome (individual fairness) to prevent discrimination against certain attributes. Drawing definitions from legal frameworks, the term “protected attribute” refers to the characteristics that are often protected under anti-discrimination laws, such as gender or race. Mathematically, the following metrics are often used to demonstrate scores that support fairness:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt>Statistical parity</dt>
<dd>
This measure seeks to uncover whether a model is fair towards protected attributes by measuring the difference between the majority and protected class in receiving a favourable outcome. A value of 0 demonstrates the model to be fair.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Disparate impact</dt>
<dd>
This compares the percentage of favourable outcomes for the monitored group to the percentage of favourable outcomes for a reference group. The groups compared can be the majority group and minority group, and this score will highlight in whose direction decisions are biased. For example, if a model grants loans to 60% of people in a middle-aged group and only 50% for those of other age cohorts, then the disparate impact is 0.8, which indicates a positive bias towards the middle-aged group and an adverse impact on the remaining cohorts.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Equality of odds</dt>
<dd>
This measures the balance of the true positive rate and false positive rate between protected and unprotected groups, which seeks to uncover whether a model performs similarly for the two groups.
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to remember that statistics are only one side of the fairness problem for machine learning, and one that treats the symptoms of bias as opposed to the underlying causes. In addition to the aforementioned technical approaches, there are a variety of non-technical measures that teams developing AI systems can adopt to augment fairness and inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt>Definition of fairness</dt>
<dd>
Organisations that develop or use AI systems need to define, practically, what it means to be fair. Although there are various quantitative fairness measures, these are based on assumptions of fairness in society, which could be defined for each specific use case.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Diversity on teams</dt>
<dd>
There’s been a sharpened focus on the value of team diversity to areas such as productivity and creativity. The same is true for ethics. Ensuring that product teams are composed of a broad cross-section of identities can help to organically drive fairness through diversity of thought and experience.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Education and self-reflection</dt>
<dd>
Developing knowledge within individuals and teams about the socio-technical aspects of AI – that is, the ways in which AI shapes our social, political, economic, and environmental lives. The more critical a person can be as a data scientist in questioning why something is being built, the more likely they are to proactively recognise risks surrounding fairness.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Consider the end user</dt>
<dd>
Imagine that you are on a development team building an AI solution for a problem in the agricultural sector pertaining to livestock health. Who is best suited to solving the problem: a data scientist or a farmer? As a data scientist, you may have the tools to develop a solution, but given your distance from the end user, you are unlikely to intimately understand the problem in the same way a farmer would. If you cannot understand the problem, you cannot hope to find a solution, much less an ethical one. Recognising the importance of consulting individuals that are representative of end users is key to ensure that your design is fair.
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>AI ethics review boards</dt>
<dd>
Data science teams should not operate in isolation. Increasingly, organisations are establishing AI ethics review boards or similar forums that are intended to act as checks on the design decisions made throughout AI development. Does your organisation have one?
</dd>
</dl></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>These three areas – transparency, explainability, and fairness – are the starting points to embed and operationalise AI ethics in technical development. Transparency relies on both technical and non-technical documentation to facilitate discussions with non-technical stakeholders, as well as to create and enforce accountabilities. Explainability helps to build trust in AI output by vesting us with an ability to explain “why”. Finally, adopting both technical and non-technical measures of fairness can ensure that AI products in development do not adversely impact certain groups.</p>
<p>In addition to these three areas of AI ethics, within EY we have two other focus areas – resilience and high-performance – that form part of our Trusted AI Framework. We will discuss these in a future article. We’re also keen to explore topics such as generating trust in generative AI! Until then, please share your stories of developing ethical AI projects in the comments below. How are you translating AI ethics from theory into practice?</p>

<p>Read on to discover more about Claire’s data science career (so far).</p>
<div class="keyline">
<hr>
</div>
<p><strong>Hi, Claire. Thank you for sharing your career story with Real World Data Science. Please tell us a little about yourself and your role in data science.</strong><br>
My name is Claire Morton, and I’m an undergraduate student studying mathematical and computational science and environmental justice at Stanford University. I’m particularly interested in using statistics and data science to work with community-based organizations and advance evidence-based environmental justice policy. I have conducted quantitative research on tools to classify disadvantaged communities, oil wells, climate resilience, housing justice, and the connections between soil and health.</p>
<p><strong>What drew you to study statistics and data science?</strong><br>
I really enjoyed my math, statistics, and coding classes in school. I was also inspired by the power that numerical data have to tell stories and promote policy change.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist?</strong><br>
Listening to others. Listening allows me to learn new statistics skills from my mentors and to learn about how best I can work with community partners on their priorities in my research.</p>
<p><strong>How does your gender and/or sexual identity factor into your career?</strong><br>
I am a lesbian, and, at the start of college, I didn’t have any mentors who shared my identity. I’ve now found several through the ASA and queer communities at my university, and I’m continually inspired by the achievements of queer statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists. My research hasn’t explicitly connected statistics and queerness yet, but I’m interested in working on projects involving hard-to-reach populations, such as queer people, in the future.</p>

<p>It’s important to be able to take initiative to learn skills, talk to people, and solve problems as they come up – but it’s also critical to not be afraid of asking for help when you need it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>How did you get into data science?</strong><br>
In high school, I worked in a cell biology lab. As part of that work, I learned to model cellular processes and analyze data from my experiments. I realized that those elements were my favorite parts of the science I was doing, so I decided to study math, computer science, and/or statistics in college. I had always been interested in environmental issues, and so I got involved in quantitative research about environmental justice. I realized that this type of research allowed me to connect the skills I have to my passions, so I’ve kept working in these areas ever since.</p>
<p><strong>What, or who, first inspired you to pursue this career path?</strong><br>
My mom! She’s also a statistician, and she has encouraged and mentored me throughout my academic journey. I’m inspired by her success as a woman in statistics.</p>
<p><strong>What hurdles or challenges have you faced in your studies?</strong><br>
My classes can be tough, which makes it hard to stay motivated sometimes. I also struggled to maintain a healthy work-life balance at the start of college. Finally, it has been tough to learn some of the ins and outs of the research process and publications – how best to engage with research mentors, what it looks like to write and submit a paper, and some of the nuances of working in academia. I think my next big challenge is deciding what to do after college, though I’ve been trying to reframe the question as an opportunity rather than a hurdle. I’m excited to continue doing research at the intersection of statistics and public policy in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first job in data science, and how does it compare to your current role?</strong><br>
My first job in data science was as a researcher, working at a non-profit called Physicians, Scientists, and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE). As part of this job, I worked with community-based organizations to code quantitative optimization models to locate climate resilience hubs in California that took community priorities into account. I’m currently a student, which involves less research but gives me the chance to focus on learning new skills for my next job. I hope to be able to work in a role like my job at PSE, combining statistics/data science, community engagement, and policy impact, in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most important thing you learned in your first year on the job?</strong><br>
The importance of being adaptable and self-directed. Research projects shift and change as you uncover new information, and it’s useful to be able to shift with them. It’s important to be able to take initiative to learn skills, talk to people, and solve problems as they come up – but it’s also critical to not be afraid of asking for help when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your career highlights so far?</strong><br>
One was publishing research about the demographics of people living near oil wells in California, which informed policymakers about racial and socioeconomic differences in exposure to oil wells and is part of a long-standing effort from activists and researchers to protect the health of Californians. I’ve also gotten to work directly with organizers on several mapping projects, which was deeply fulfilling. Finally, I loved getting to present my research at the Joint Statistical Meetings last year, and I look forward to presenting my undergraduate thesis this year.</p>
<p><strong>What three things are at the top of your reading/study list?</strong><br>
Some statistical areas I’m hoping to learn more about are spatial statistics and survey methods. Some books I’m excited to read are <em>The Color of Law</em>, <em>Data Feminism</em>, and <em>Thicker Than Blood: How Racial Statistics Lie</em>. </p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give for anyone wanting to study statistics and data science?</strong><br>
Find mentors that inspire you, support your career goals, and challenge you to learn and grow as a statistician.</p>
<p><strong>What new ideas or developments in the field are you most excited about or intrigued by?</strong><br>
I’m really interested in combining quantitative research with community-based research, so I think that cross-disciplinary developments are exciting. I’m intrigued by AI tools, and I’m interested to see how these tools change what the day-to-day of being a statistician looks like and the skills that are most sought after in a statistician.</p>
<p><strong>And what do you think will be the main challenges facing the profession over the next few years?</strong><br>
The main challenges will be related to statistical literacy, both for the people consuming and doing statistics. While statistical methods and data becoming more accessible is a positive development, it has meant that more analyses are done incorrectly and that more misleading results are publicized (and absorbed) as truth. It’s getting much easier to twist numbers to support whatever we want them to say, and I think this will continue to challenge both statisticians and non-statisticians in the future.</p>

<div class="keyline">
<hr>
</div>
<p><strong>Hi, Albert. Thank you for sharing your career story with Real World Data Science. Please tell us a little about yourself and your role in data science.</strong><br>
My name is Albert Lee. I’m the founding partner at Summit Consulting, a quantitative and financial consulting firm in Washington, DC. Summit delivers data-driven solutions to help make government effective and society just. I started Summit in 2003, and we recently celebrated our 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>I received my PhD in economics from UCLA in 1999. My professional practice is focused on econometrics – an academic specialty that blends economic theory with statistical practices – and statistical sampling.</p>
<p><strong>What does your job involve?</strong><br>
A large portion of my time is spent running Summit and making decisions about management, personnel, and business development. That said, I am still pretty active in technical topics. I am a testifying expert in econometrics and statistical sampling. Recently, I have been leading a team of data scientists who are reformulating the edit and imputation algorithms for the US Department of Agriculture’s National Agriculture Statistical Service, which collects survey data from US agriculture sectors.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist?</strong><br>
Explaining technical concepts is a big part of my job, and it requires the ability to consume the technical literature and know the concepts well enough that I can explain them to a lay audience (such as lawyers, judges, and program staff).</p>
<p><strong>How has your gender and/or sexual identity factored into your career?</strong><br>
My gender and identity have given me important perspective as a data scientist and an entrepreneur. Living my identity takes courage. It is the same courage necessary to start a new business. From a young age, my identity has conditioned me to be comfortable with differences.</p>
<p>My identity has also taught me to see similarity among differences. Empathy is essential in client services and especially in quantitative consulting, where some of my clients feel disempowered by the complex subject matter.</p>

<p>The data science field is moving very fast. Every day brings a new algorithm, software program, and hardware innovation. Since data science is a multidisciplinary field, keeping up with it has been challenging.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>How did you get into data science?</strong><br>
Although I studied mathematics and economics as an undergraduate student and economics as a graduate student, my academic training was very theoretical. I didn’t work with data and computers extensively until my first job outside of academia in the early 2000s. Little did I know that it was the advent of the “big data” revolution.</p>
<p>At Summit we serve mostly federal agencies, who are sitting on decades of administrative data – information they collected as part of their mission but not of research quality. These agencies want to use their administrative data to automate their routine tasks (like predicting which loans will default first) and evaluate program efficacy (determining whether a training program reached its goals). Extracting and analyzing administrative data has been a big part of my career.</p>
<p>When I founded Summit, data science was not a recognized discipline. But as the datasets get larger, decisions about hardware setup, software programs, estimation algorithms, and data virtualization have become increasingly intertwined and interdependent. This really was my first taste of data science as we know it today.</p>
<p><strong>What, or who, first inspired you to become a data scientist?</strong><br>
There are too many people to mention by name. I owe a lot of my career to my first two managers at KPMG, Alan Salzberg and Rick Holt. They taught me how to code and reason quantitatively. And Rob Gould at UCLA has patiently converted a theorist to an empiricist. Once a convert, now a zealot.</p>
<p><strong>What were the hurdles or challenges that you needed to overcome on your route into the profession?</strong><br>
I am an immigrant and a first-generation college graduate. My journey was full of unknowns. Figuring out my academic and professional career has taken a lot of exploration. In this regard, the same exploration that guided my identity also guided my academic and professional journey.</p>
<p><strong>And what are the challenges that you face now that you are working in data science?</strong><br>
The data science field is moving very fast. Every day brings a new algorithm, software program, and hardware innovation. Since data science is a multidisciplinary field, keeping up with it has been challenging. As I progress along my professional journey, striking the right balance between management, hands-on practice, and learning has been difficult as well.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first job in data science, and how does it compare to your current role?</strong><br>
As an entrepreneur, I was given a lot of professional freedom to actualize my career. To a large extent, I have the career that I envisioned. To me, data science lives in the intersection of methods, software, and hardware. I have spent a large part of my career in this intersection.</p>
<p>Of course there are many things that were not part of the original vision, such as running a 100-person organization. My approach has always been intention with openness. By this metric, my current role is not far off from my original vision.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most important thing you learned in your first year on the job?</strong><br>
The ability and the love of learning constantly, regardless of the topic.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your career highlights so far?</strong><br>
The biggest highlight was that on June 15, 2023, Summit celebrated its 20th anniversary! Reformulating the National Agricultural Statistics Service’s edit and imputation systems is also a big deal. And being a testifying expert in some of the most consequential legal cases in the United States was a highlight as well.</p>
<p><strong>What three things are at the top of your current reading/study list?</strong><br>
In recent years, I have been binge-reading Stoic philosophy. I have read most books by Ryan Holiday. His most recent book was <em>Ego Is the Enemy</em>. In between the Stoics, you will find me reading Buddhist meditation literature, including Thich Nhat Hanh’s <em>The Heart of the Buddha’s Teaching</em>. David McCullough’s <em>Truman</em> is also by my bedside.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist?</strong><br>
Be open and multidisciplinary. Many good ideas in statistics come from other fields, such as economics, medicine, sociology, and education. Computer science enables computational statistics. Having the openness to these topics is key.</p>
<p><strong>What new ideas or developments in the field are you personally most excited about or intrigued by?</strong><br>
Machine learning has transformed statistics both as a consumer and a contributor. It consumes statistics in that it requires cutting-edge statistical techniques and algorithms for its estimation. Machine learning has important applications in many of the statistical sciences.</p>
<p><strong>And what do you think will be the main challenges facing the profession over the next few years?</strong><br>
The proper use of statistics or statistical ethics is an important societal challenge. Machine learning is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and its applications are more broad and pervasive. Machine learning algorithms are making more and more decisions in society, including mortgage loan approvals, residential home prices, and which prisoners receive parole. These are important and weighty decisions. How do we know that these decisions are unbiased and fair?</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Hi, Chanuki. Thank you for sharing your career story with Real World Data Science. Please tell us a little about yourself and your role in data science.</strong><br>
I am Chanuki Seresinhe, head of data science at Zoopla and Hometrack. My commercial career in data science began in 2018 at Channel 4. Since then, I have worked at a few different companies – from startups to scale-ups – before ending up here at Zoopla in 2022.</p>
<p>I am also the founder of <a href="https://www.beautifulplaces.ai/">beautifulplaces.ai</a>, which is a continuation of my University of Warwick and Alan Turing Institute PhD work where I provided the first large-scale evidence that beautiful places are connected to our wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>What does your job involve?</strong><br>
My role at Zoopla involves managing data scientists both for Zoopla and Hometrack. At Zoopla, we use data science to create an engaging experience for users who want to buy, sell and rent properties. At Hometrack, the data scientists mainly work on an automated valuation model that provides property valuations to most of the major mortgage lenders in the UK.</p>
<p>As a leader in data science, my role primarily involves helping stakeholders across the business to best leverage data science to reach our business goals, as well as ensuring my data science team has all the support and mentoring they need to design, develop and maintain high performing data science algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>What does “data science” mean to you?</strong><br>
That is a really good question! One thing I have noticed is that people who aren’t familiar with the field often confuse data science and data analytics. There are indeed many similarities – both require quite a bit of knowledge to be able to leverage the correct insights from both structured and unstructured data (data hidden within images, for example). However, data science is essential when you need to make inferences. For instance, you are not only analysing data to see what certain consumers may prefer, but you are also predicting what similar consumers might prefer. Thus, having a strong grounding in statistics is really important for anyone working in this field.</p>

<p>In data science, getting the model right is not enough, and working with people across the business to make sure the model can be integrated into the business processes is essential.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>What do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist?</strong><br>
Aside from a good grounding in the technical aspects of data science (which is possible for really anyone to pick up from the many good courses that are available), the most important skill is how you can leverage data science to create products that actually create value for the business. I find this to be the most challenging journey that junior data scientists find themselves having to navigate. They are really excited about the technology, and get carried away with wanting to perfect their algorithms. But when you are building commercial products, what is really important is to constantly engage with stakeholders to make sure you are building something that actually has a tangible business benefit. Early release of a model for user testing is also essential, as models only really get better once you have real user input.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into data science?</strong><br>
It was somewhat by accident. I previously had a long career in digital and decided to take a career break to return to university and study economics. When I was working on my Master’s degree in behavioral economic science at the University of Warwick, I saw an ad for a PhD to “use online data to understand human behaviour” and I thought this was perfect, as it combined my prior knowledge with a new area I was increasingly becoming drawn to. I quickly taught myself how to program in Python and convinced my supervisors to take me on, and from there on, I came to love data science!</p>
<p><strong>What, or who, first inspired you to become a data scientist?</strong><br>
It was more about realising what you could do with data science. In my PhD, I was quantifying the connection between beautiful places and our wellbeing. While this has long been an intuitive connection, we were not able to test this on a large scale due to lack of data. Being able to use data science to start predicting the beauty of outdoor images was fascinating as it opened up a whole new method for potential research combining beauty with various wellbeing ratings. Once I started to see what was possible with data science, there was no going back.</p>
<p><strong>What were the hurdles or challenges that you needed to overcome on your route into the profession?</strong><br>
For me personally it was the challenge of moving sideways into a leadership role after my PhD and not having to start all the way from the bottom. I would have loved to continue in academia and expand my research even further, but starting from the bottom earning a tiny salary after I had taken quite a large career break to do my PhD wasn’t an option for me. So I decided to go back into the commercial world and look for a senior role from the get go and luckily Channel 4 agreed to give me my first commercial stab at data science.</p>
<p><strong>What are the challenges that you face now, as a working data scientist?</strong><br>
Trying to keep up with everything that is constantly changing in the world of data science. I love the rapid change but it can also be quite time consuming to make sure you are on top of it and giving the right advice to people.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first job in data science, and how does it compare to your current role?</strong><br>
My first job was working as a senior data scientist at Channel 4. As a senior data scientist, even though you have additional goals to help run the team and be a mentor to more junior data scientists, you still get a great deal of time to do coding and develop your own projects. When you move more into a management role, the time you have to develop data science models diminishes. People also expect you to give in-depth guidance when you haven’t actually had much time to deep dive into a project. So, I am often trying hard to make sure I am on top of what is going on even when I have limited time, and really focus on building a strong team that can support each other and collaborate often to create better data science products. Learning to delegate is key!</p>
<p><strong>What was the most important thing you learned in your first year on the job?</strong><br>
How hard it is to actually get organisational buy-in to use data science at scale. It is really easy to get approval to build a proof of concept (POC). However, if you do not use the time when developing your POC to also make sure to get the right stakeholder on board, your project is dead before it even starts. So, in data science, getting the model right is not enough, and working with people across the business to make sure the model can be integrated into the business processes is essential.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your career highlights so far?</strong><br>
It has been great being able to give talks about my research, and data science in general, all around the world. I have actually come to love public speaking, and I hope that as I continue to be recognised for my expertise, I can encourage and aid potential data scientists with their careers – especially minority women, as I think that diversity in the field is very important. This is a role that is fit for people from all kinds of backgrounds and I hope I am exemplifying this.</p>
<p><strong>Have there been any mistakes or regrets along the way?</strong><br>
In smaller companies, it can easily happen that the founders don’t fully understand data science and often use data science as a buzzword to get investors on board. Whenever you take on a new job, and data science is just getting established, make sure the founders or leaders are actually fully onboard with integrating data science into the product and understand what this means. See if they know how tricky data science can be when first integrating into a product and are actually willing to overcome the challenges with you to eventually reap the huge benefits data science can bring.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think your role will evolve over the rest of your career?</strong><br>
I see my role evolving into being more strategic and less about the data science day-to-day modelling. It is more about being able to advise companies on how to make use of data science as a strategy and helping them figure out where in the product or process to inject it to get the most out of it for the business as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>If you were starting out in data science now, what would you put at the top of your reading or study list?</strong><br>
Practise how you would apply using data science for a real life problem. Seek a placement, as this will pay dividends in being able to speed up your learning.</p>
<p>If you don’t understand the statistics involved in data science, make sure to upskill in that area before starting your first role. A lot of junior data scientists focus on learning how to code or get carried away with the modelling without first learning the importance of preparing the data in the correct way so that your predictions can work well in a real life setting.</p>
<p><strong>What personal or professional advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist now?</strong><br>
Try to find ways to stand out from the average data scientist. When we open up applications for data science jobs, I get hundreds of applications for each one. I am looking for people who can not only do data science but who also have other stand-out qualities that they can bring to the business. This can be something along the lines of effective stakeholder engagement to deep expertise in a certain domain or technology.</p>
<p><strong>What new ideas or developments in the field of data science are you personally most excited about or intrigued by?</strong><br>
I am really interested to see where generative AI will take us – particularly about how it can help us improve the speed of our own performance. It feels like generative AI can be a technology that can help everyone – even the everyday person – as it can help speed up so many processes, from coding to writing to ideating. While the technology is still in its early days, it is progressing rapidly and I am very curious to see where this will lead in the next year!</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the main challenges facing data science as a field in the next few years?</strong><br>
Generative AI’s latest breakthroughs have made AI capabilities accessible to the broader public, but it has also stoked fears around the use of AI. The headline-grabbing narratives around AI and existential threat is distracting from other conversations that are really important. There are some very real issues we do need to solve – from biases in AI to the impact generative AI can have on wages and workforce – but this needs to be approached in a constructive and thoughtful way.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to engage with the public in a more meaningful way – rather than scaremongering – to have public debates on issues that actually matter.</p>

  <title>The road to reproducible research: hazards to avoid and tools to get you there safely</title>
  <dc:creator>Davit Svanidze, Andre Python, et al.</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Reproducibility, or “<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/AC_Materials/SBE_Robust_and_Reliable_Research_Report.pdf">the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as the original investigator</a>”, is critical for sharing and building upon scientific findings. Reproducibility not only verifies the correctness of processes leading to results but also serves as a prerequisite for assessing generalisability to other datasets or contexts. This we refer to as replicability, or “<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/AC_Materials/SBE_Robust_and_Reliable_Research_Report.pdf">the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study if the same procedures are followed but new data are collected</a>”. Reproducibility, which is the focus of our work here, can be challenging – especially in the context of deep learning. This article, and associated material, aims to provide practical advice for overcoming these challenges.</p>
<p>Our story begins with Davit Svanidze, a master’s degree student in economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Davit’s efforts to make his bachelor’s thesis reproducible are what inspires this article, and we hope that readers will be able to learn from Davit’s experience and apply those learnings to their own work. Davit will demonstrate the use of Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, and other relevant tools to ensure reproducibility. He will walk us through code documentation, data management, and version control with Git. And, he will share best practices for collaboration, peer review, and dissemination of results.</p>
<p>Davit’s story starts here, but there is much more for the interested reader to discover. At certain points in this article, we will direct readers to other resources, namely a <a href="https://github.com/dsvanidze/replicability/blob/master/notebooks/main.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dsvanidze/replicability">GitHub repository</a> which contain all the instructions, data and code necessary to reproduce Davit’s research. Together, these components offer a comprehensive overview of the thought process and technical implementation required for reproducibility. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the principles remain consistent.</p>

<p>The focus of my bachelor’s thesis was to better understand the initial spread of Covid-19 in China using deep learning algorithms. I was keen to make my work reproducible, but not only for my own sake. The “reproducibility crisis” is a well-documented problem in science as a whole,<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup> with studies suggesting that around one-third of social science studies published between the years 2010 and 2015 in top journals like <em>Nature</em> and <em>Science</em> could not be reproduced.<sup>5</sup> Results that cannot be reproduced are not necessarily “wrong”. But, if findings cannot be reproduced, we cannot be sure of their validity.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/dsvanidze/replicability/blob/master/notebooks/main.ipynb">my own research project</a>, I gathered all data and started working on my computer. After I built the algorithms to train the data, my first challenge to reproducibility was computational. I realised that training models on my local computer was taking far too long, and I needed a faster, more powerful solution to be able to submit my thesis in time. Fortunately, I could access the university server to train the algorithms. Once the training was complete, I could generate the results on my local computer, since producing maps and tables was not so demanding. However…</p>
</section>
<section id="bloody-paths" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bloody-paths">Bloody paths!</h3>
<p>In switching between machines and computing environments, I soon encountered an issue with my code: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)">paths</a>, or file directory locations, for the trained algorithms had been hardcoded! As I quickly discovered, hardcoding a path can lead to issues when the code is run in a different environment, as the path might not exist in the new environment.</p>
<p>As my code became longer, I overlooked the path names linked to algorithms that were generating the results. This mistake – which would have been easily corrected if spotted earlier – resulted in incorrect outputs. Such errors could have enormous (negative) implications in a public health context, where evidence-based decisions have real impacts on human lives. It was at this point that I realised that my code is the fundamental pillar of the validity of my empirical work. How can someone trust my work if they are not able to verify it?</p>
<p>The following dummy code demonstrates the hardcoding issue:</p>

<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/06/15/images/hardcoded-paths-1.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the code above, a dummy file (<code>toydata.csv</code>) is used. The dummy file contains data on the prices of three different toys, but only the path of the file is relevant to this example. If the hardcoded file path – <code>"/user/notebooks/toydata.csv"</code> – exists on the machine being used, the code will run just fine. But, when run in a different environment without said path, the code will result in a <code>"File not found error"</code>. Better code that uses relative paths can be written as:</p>

<p>Everything looks fine at a glance. But, if you examine the code carefully, you may spot the problem. Initially, when I coded the procedure (training the model, saving and loading the results), I hardcoded the paths and had to change them for each tested model. First, I trained <code>model2</code>, a complex model, and tested it against the benchmark (70 &gt; 50 → accepted). I repeated the procedure for <code>model1</code> (a simple model). Its result was identical to <code>model2</code>, therefore I kept <code>model1</code> following the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/parsimony-principle">parsimony principle</a>.</p>
<p>However, for the code line loading the result for the current model (line 5, second cell), I forgot to amend the path and so mistakenly loaded the result of <code>model2</code>. As a consequence, I accepted a model which should have been rejected. These wrong results were then spread further in the code, including all charts and maps and the conclusions of my analysis.</p>
<p>A small coding error like this can therefore be fatal to an analysis. Below is the corrected code:</p>

<p>Here, the paths are stored with other model details (line 7–8, first cell). Therefore, we can use them as variables when we need them (e.g., line 16, first cell, and line 5, second cell). Now, when the current model is set to <code>model1</code> (line 11, first cell), everything is automatically adjusted. Also, if the path details need to be changed, we only need to change them once and everything else is automatically adjusted and updated. The code now correctly states that <code>model1</code> performs worse than the benchmark and is therefore rejected and we should keep <code>model2</code>, which performs best.</p>
<p>I managed to catch this error in time, but it often can be difficult to spot our own mistakes. That is why making code available to others is crucial. A code review by a second (or third) pair of eyes can save everyone a lot of time and avoid spreading incorrect results and conclusions.</p>

<p>One might think that it would be easy to copy code from one computer to another and run it without difficulties, but it turns out to be a real headache. Different operating systems on my local computer and the university server caused multiple compatibility issues and it was very time-consuming to try to solve them. The university server was running on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution, which was not compatible with my macOS-based code editor. Moreover, the server did not support the Python programming language – and all the deep learning algorithm packages that I needed – in the same way as my macOS computer did.</p>
<p>As a remedy, I used Docker containers, which allowed me to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages and dependencies installed. This way, I could integrate them with different hardware and use the processing power of that hardware. To get started with Docker, I first had to install it on my local computer. The installation process is straightforward and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">the Docker website</a> provides step-by-step instructions for different operating systems. In fact, I found the Docker website very helpful, with lots of resources and tutorials available. Once Docker was installed, it was easy to create virtual environments for my project and work with my code, libraries, and packages, without any compatibility issues. Not only did Docker containers save me a lot of time and effort, but they could also make it easier for others to reproduce my work.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a Dockerfile which recreates an environment with Python 3.7 on Linux. It describes what, how, when and in which order operations should be carried out to generate the environment with all Python packages required to run the main Python script, <code>main.py</code>.</p>

<p>In this example, by downloading the project, including the Dockerfile, anyone can run <code>main.py</code> without installing packages or worrying about what OS was used for development or which Python version should be installed. You can view Docker as a great robot chef: show it a recipe (Dockerfile), provide the ingredients (project files), push the start button (to build the container) and wait to sample the results.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-nobody-check-your-code">Why does nobody check your code?</h3>
<p>Even after implementing Docker, I still faced another challenge to reproducibility: making the verification process for my code easy enough that it could be done by anyone, without them needing a degree in computer science! Increasingly, there is an expectation for researchers to share their code so that results can be reproduced, but there are as yet no widely accepted or enforced standards on how to make code readable and reusable. However, if we are to embrace the concept of reproducibility, we must write and publish code under the assumption that someone, somewhere – boss, team member, journal reviewer, reader – will want to rerun our code. And, if we expect that someone will want to rerun our code (and hopefully check it), we should ensure that the code is readable and does not take too long to run.</p>
<p>If your code <em>does</em> take too long to run, some operations can often be accelerated – for example, by reducing the size of the datasets or by implementing computationally efficient data processing approaches (e.g., using <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>). Aim for a running time of a few minutes – or about as long as it takes to make a cup of tea or coffee. Of course, if data needs to be reduced to save computational time, the person rerunning your code won’t generate the same results as in your original analysis. This therefore will not lead to reproducibility, <em>sensu stricto</em>. However, as long as you state clearly what are the expected results from the reduced dataset, your peers can at least inspect your code and offer feedback, and this marks a step towards reproducibility.</p>
<p>We should also make sure our code is free from bugs – both the kind that might lead to errors in analysis and also those that stop the code running to completion. Bugs can occur for various reasons. For example, some code chunks written on a Windows machine may not properly execute on a macOS machine because the former uses <code>\</code> for file paths, while the latter uses <code>/</code>:</p>

<p>By this stage in my project, I was feeling that I’d made good progress towards ensuring that my work would be reproducible. I’d expended a lot of effort to make my code readable, efficient, and also absent of bugs (or, at least, this is what I was hoping for). I’d also built a Docker container to allow others to replicate my computing environment and rerun the analysis. Still, I wanted to make sure there were no barriers that would prevent people – my supervisors, in particular – from being able to review the work I had done for my undergraduate thesis. What I wanted was a way to present a complete narrative of my project that was easy to understand and follow. For this, I turned to Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<p>Jupyter notebooks combine <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown text</a>, code, and visualisations. The notebook itself can sit within an online directory of folders and files that contain all the data and code related to a project, allowing readers to understand the processes behind the work and also access the raw resources. From <a href="https://github.com/dsvanidze/replicability/blob/master/notebooks/main.ipynb">the notebook I produced</a>, readers can see exactly what I did, how I did it, and what my results were.</p>
<p>While creating my notebook, I was able to experiment with my code and iterate quickly. Code cells within a document can be run interactively, which allowed me to try out different approaches to solving a problem and see the results almost in real time. I could also get feedback from others and try out new ideas without having to spend a lot of time writing and debugging code.</p>

<p>My Jupyter notebook and associated folders and files are all available via <a href="https://github.com/dsvanidze/replicability">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a central repository for storing and sharing code. With Git and GitHub, I was able to version my code and collaborate with others without the risk of losing any work. I really couldn’t afford to redo the entire year I spent on my dissertation!</p>
<p>Git and GitHub are great for reproducibility. By sharing code via these platforms, others can access your work, verify it and reproduce your results without risking changing or, worse, destroying your work – whether partially or completely. These tools also make it easy for others to build on your work if they want to further develop your research. You can also use Git and GitHub to share or promote your results across a wider community. The ability to easily store and share your code also makes it easy to keep track of the different versions of your code and to see how your work has evolved.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the tracking of very simple changes in a Python file. The previous version of the code is shown on the left; the new version is shown on the right. Additions and deletions are highlighted in green and red, and with <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> symbols, respectively.</p>

<section id="the-deep-learning-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deep-learning-challenge">The deep learning challenge</h2>
<p>So far, this article has dealt with barriers to reproducibility – and ways around them – that will apply to most, if not all, modern research projects. While I’d encourage any scientist to adopt these practices in their own work, it is important to stress that these alone cannot guarantee reproducibility. In cases where standard statistical procedures are used within statistical software packages, reproducibility is often achievable. However, in reality, even when following the same procedures, differences in outputs can occur, and identifying the reasons for this may be challenging. Cooking offers a simple analogy: subtle changes in room temperature or ingredient quality from one day to the next can impact the final product.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for research projects employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that outputs can be influenced by the randomness that is inherent in these approaches. Consider the four portraits below, generated by the Midjourney bot.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/06/15/images/DL_bkg.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Four portraits rendered by generative AI. Each portrait looks broadly similar, but there are noticeable differences in facial features and the abstract patterns overlaid on the portraits"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p>Each portrait looks broadly similar at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, critical differences emerge. These differences arise because deep learning models rely on numerous interconnected layers to learn intricate patterns and representations. Slight random perturbations, such as initial parameter values or changes in data samples, can propagate through the network, leading to different decisions during the learning process. As a result, even seemingly negligible randomness can amplify and manifest as considerable differences in the final output, as with the distinct features of the portraits.</p>
<p>Randomness is not necessarily a bad thing – it mitigates overfitting and helps predictions to be generalised. However, it does present an additional barrier to reproducibility. If you cannot get the same results using the same raw materials – data, code, packages and computing environment – then you might have good reasons to doubt the validity of the findings.</p>
<p>There are many elements of an analysis in which randomness may be present and lead to different results. For example, in a classification (where your dependent variable is binary, e.g., success/failure with 1 and 0) or a regression (where your dependent variable is continuous, e.g., temperature measurements of 10.1°C, 2.8°C, etc.), you might need to split your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to estimate the model (hyper)parameters and the testing set is used to compute the performance of the model. The way the split is usually operationalised is as a random selection of rows of your data. So, in principle, each time you split your data into training and testing sets, you may end up with different rows in each set. Differences in the training set may therefore lead to different values of the model (hyper)parameters and affect the predictive performance that is measured from the testing set. Also, differences in the testing set may lead to variations in the predictive performance scores, which in turn lead to potentially different interpretations and, ultimately, decisions if the results are used for that purpose.</p>
<p>This aspect of randomness in the training of models is relatively well known. But randomness may hide in other parts of code. One such example is illustrated below. Here, using Python, we set the seed number to 0 using <code>np.random.seed(seed value)</code>. The <code>random.seed()</code> function from the package <code>numpy</code> (abbreviated <code>np</code>) saves the state of a random function so that it can create identical random numbers independently of the machine you use, and this is for any number of executions. A seed value is an initial input or starting point used by a pseudorandom number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers. It is often an integer or a timestamp. The number generator takes this seed value and uses it to produce a deterministic series of random numbers that appear to be random but can be recreated by using the same seed value. Without providing this seed value, the first execution of the function typically uses the current system time. The animation below generates two random arrays <code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code> using <code>np.random.rand(3,2)</code>. Note that the values <code>3,2</code> indicate that we want random values for an array that has 3 rows and 2 columns.</p>

<p>If you run the code yourself multiple times, the values of <code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code> should remain identical. If this is not the case, check that the seed value is set to 0 in lines 4 and 11. These identical results are possible because we set the seed value to 0, which ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers each time the code is run.

<p>Here, the values of <code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code> will be different each time we run the code since the seed value was not set and is therefore changing over time.</p>
<p>This short code demonstrates how randomness that can be controlled by the seed value may affect your code. Therefore, unless randomness is required, e.g., to get some uncertainty in the results, setting the seed value will contribute to making your work reproducible. I also find it helpful to document the seed number I use in my code so that I can easily reproduce my findings in the future. If you are currently working on some code that involves random number generators, it might be worth checking your code and making all necessary changes. In our work (see code chunk 9 in <a href="https://github.com/dsvanidze/replicability/blob/master/notebooks/main.ipynb">the Jupyter notebook</a>) we set the seed value in a general way, using a framework (config) so that our code always uses the same seed to train our algorithm.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope you have enjoyed learning more about our quest for reproducibility. We have explained why reproducibility matters and provided tips for how to achieve it – or, at least, work towards it. We have introduced a few important issues that you are likely to encounter on your own path to reproducibility. In sum, we have mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of having relative instead of hard-coded paths in code.</li>
<li>Operating system compatibility issues, which can be solved by using Docker containers for a consistent computing environment.</li>
<li>The convenience of Jupyter notebooks for code editing – particularly useful for data science projects and work using deep learning because of the ability to include text and code in the same document and make the work accessible to everyone (so long as they have an internet connection).</li>
<li>The need for version control using, for example, Git and GitHub, which allows you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others efficiently.</li>
<li>The importance of setting the seed values in random number generators.</li>

<p>We use (A) the version control system, Git, and its hosting service, GitHub, which enables a team to share code with peers, efficiently track and synchronise code changes between local and server machines, and reset the project to a working state in case something breaks. Docker containers (B) include all necessary objects (engine, data, and scripts). Docker needs to be installed (plain-line arrows) by all users (project leader, collaborator(s), reviewer(s), and public user(s)) on their local machines (C); and (D) we use a user-friendly interface (JupyterLab) deployed from a local machine to facilitate the operations required to reproduce the work. The project leader and collaborators can edit (upload/download) the project files stored on the GitHub server (plain-line arrows) while reviewers and public users can only read the files (dotted-line arrows).</p>

  <title>How do people feel about AI? Well, it’s complicated</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>How do people feel about AI? That was a question recently explored in a survey of 4,000 British residents. The answer is that, well, it depends.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Ada Lovelace Institute and the Alan Turing Institute designed the survey to ask about specific AI use cases, rather than the concept of AI more broadly. Use cases included face recognition for policing, border control and security, targeted advertising for political campaigns and consumer products, virtual assistants, driverless cars, and so on.</p>
<p>Roshni Modhvadia, a researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute and member of the survey team, reported that respondents overall were broadly positive towards most of the use cases they were asked about. Healthcare applications (using AI to assess the risk of cancer, for example) or face recognition for border security were seen as very or somewhat beneficial by more than 80% of those surveyed. More than half of respondents thought that other applications, such as virtual reality in education, climate research simulations, and robotic care assistants were very or somewhat beneficial.</p>
<p>Views were less positive towards applications including driverless cars, autonomous weapons and targeted advertising. These were the applications that respondents expressed most concern about, and for each of these use cases perceived risks were felt to outweigh perceived benefits.</p>
<p>And yet, even for applications that were seen as being overwhelmingly beneficial – assessing cancer risk and face recognition for border control – respondents still expressed concern about the potential for overreliance on the technologies, the issue of who is accountable for mistakes, and the impact the technologies might have on jobs and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Three-fifths (62%) of respondents said laws and regulations would make them more comfortable with AI technologies being used. This is an important finding given where the national AI conversation is at the moment, said Professor Helen Margetts, director of the public policy programme at The Alan Turing Institute.</p>
<p>The current national conversation has been fuelled by the success of ChatGPT and the growing adoption of generative AI tools. The Lovelace/Turing survey, fielded in November 2022, did not ask about ChatGPT <em>et al.</em>, but the results do at least provide a baseline against which to measure any shifts in attitudes brought on by what Professor Shannon Vallor, Baillie Gifford Chair in the Ethics of Data and Artificial Intelligence at the Edinburgh Futures Institute at the University of Edinburgh, described as “this latest round of AI hype and confusion”.</p>
<ul>
<li>For more on that theme, see Michael Timothy Bennett’s recent article, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/06/05/no-AI-probably-wont-kill-us.html">“No, AI probably won’t kill us all – and there’s more to this fear campaign than meets the&nbsp;eye”</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modhvadia, Margetts and Vallor were speaking at an online event last week to mark the launch of the survey report. Video of the event is below. The <a href="https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/public-attitudes-ai/">full report</a> is available from the Ada Lovelace Institute website.</p>

<p>A new paper in the <em>Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education</em> considers the potential for using ChatGPT in statistics and data science classrooms. Authors Amanda R. Ellis and Emily Slade of the University of Kentucky give suggestions for using ChatGPT to generate course content: lecture notes and new material such as practice quizzes or exam questions, or pseudocode for introducing students to statistical programming. It could also be used as a code debugging tool and integrated into set tasks – e.g., have students prompt ChatGPT to write code, then run the code themselves and assess whether the code works as intended.</p>
<p>“We recognize that educators have valid concerns regarding the implementation and integration of AI tools in the classroom,” write the authors, later adding that: “We encourage readers to consider other technologies, such as the calculator, WolframAlpha, and Wikipedia, all of which were met with initial wariness but are now commonly used as learning tools. As statistics and data science educators, we can actively shape and guide the incorporation of AI tools within our classrooms.”</p>

<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Hello, and welcome to Real World Data Science. I’m Brian Tarran. And today I’m joined by the organisers of the upcoming London Data Week, Sam Nutt and Jennifer Ding. Sam, Jennifer, how are you? Nice to see you here. Thank you for joining us. I wanted to start, maybe you can introduce yourselves to our viewers, tell them a little bit about your background. Sam, I don’t know if you want to go first.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Nutt</strong><br>
So I’m Sam Nutt. I’m the researcher and data ethicist at the London Office of Technology and Innovation, or LOTI. We’re about four years old. We’re an innovation unit that sits across 26 of the boroughs of London, and the Mayor of London, the GLA and we work sort of through collaborative processes to sort of foster innovation within local government, in the public sector in London. And I lead partly on our work on data ethics, as the title suggests, but also I lead our work on innovative public participation, which I guess leads nicely into maybe talking a little bit later about London Data Week. But yeah, that’s kind of my background and where I’m coming from. My interest in data, I guess, more originally came from the governance side, and how we use it properly and best in public sector context.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Excellent. Thanks, Sam. Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Ding</strong><br>
Hi, I’m Jennifer. I’m from the Alan Turing Institute, and I– the Turing, I should say is the UK’s national institute for data science and AI. And I sit on a team called Tools, Practices and Systems, or TPS, which we sometimes colloquially call the Turing’s open science team. So we focus on open, reproducible, and ethical data science practices. And at the Turing, I co-lead a team of research application managers, and our focus is making sure that the research that happens at Turing is more usable, and also actually used by more people outside of academia. In a previous life, I was a data scientist at various US tech startups, working on applied machine learning, mostly for local and national government partners. And in New York, where I was for many years, I participated in something called New York Open Data Week, which was a great introduction to the open data world, and also the civic technology world and how vibrant and exciting those communities are.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Excellent. Okay, so that– so you’ve had the exposure to data weeks before? Tell us how did London Data Week as an idea first germinate?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Nutt</strong><br>
Yeah, well, I mean, maybe I can go because it was it was something LOTI, last year, we had a sort of anniversary event, we sort of tried to bring together our community, across local government, and also partners. And so we invited [the] Alan Turing [Institute], we’ve done some work with them. And Jen came, and it was just something Jen raised to me, with me last July, you know, the idea of maybe doing something a little bit, like, inspired by some of the bits we’ve seen, for example, in New York, but also thinking, you know, what’s, what’s the London version of that? What’s the opportunity we have, given, you know, our different context to New York, and we don’t just mean in terms of, you know, you’ve got a different, like, legal context for how you use data and regulation stuff, but the cultural bits, you know, what is the physical space? How does that make London different? The people who live here, you know, what are the opportunities of London. And I think, you know, partly also inspired at the time by, you know, at least from my perspective, a real want to include, you know, ordinary people, Londoners, the public at large – all of those terms can be broken down – but effectively, to increase participation in how we think about data and how we, you know, think also about the future of the city, in a, you know, a future that we know is going to be defined by how we use data. So it kind of, it was a perfect thing where I was very inspired by, you know, I was thinking about those things, and then Jen came along. I don’t know, maybe Jen, you can talk about why you came along with that idea in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Ding</strong><br>
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Sam and I sometimes talk about how funny that chance encounter was really. I think the LOTI event was a really great example of how London’s flavour of data innovation is actually quite unique. Just gathered there with all the local councils and various other data organisations that LOTI works with. It was such a cool display of how much the public sector is involved in defining data innovation in London, and also how much academic and private tech in London is also committed to creating data and tech outputs that are for the public good. And coming from the US, I think it was very inspiring to see that organisations like LOTI, organisations like the Turing Institute, like the Ada Lovelace Institute, the Open Data Institute – there is such a great network of data for public good institutions here that are committed to, you know, centering Londoners in the conversation. And I think something that Sam and I really got to talking about was, you know, was this an opportunity also to clearly articulate what this new thing, this unique thing, is that exists in London, that if you’re here, and you work in the space, you know it, but it hasn’t really been formally articulated in the way that I think many of us know that Silicon Valley is associated with a certain kind of innovation – and may be Europe as well with regulation – but what’s happening in London is really special. And we hope that with all our great partners and our London Data Week team, we can begin to start to articulate what makes data innovation in London so special.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Please do, Jen.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And before we get carried away, we should probably pin down exactly when London Data Week is taking place. It’s beginning of July, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Ding</strong><br>
That’s right, first week of July 3rd to 9th July.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And so from what you’ve said, my understanding, broadly, maybe the aims of the week are to kind of bring together people who are working in data, who are using data and people who are affected by data, or for whom data helps sort of shape their lives, to kind of have maybe, I don’t know, a broader understanding, a kind of commonality of purpose, whatever it might be, is that is that how you would summarise it or…</p>
<p><strong>Sam Nutt</strong><br>
Very nicely summarised, are you available for comms help?</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
I am. Very expensive, though, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Nutt</strong><br>
Okay. It’s all pro bono stuff. No, I think, yeah, I think that’s really well put. It’s, yeah, it’s articulating that– coming together to start to actually build that imagination, that vision for what London is, and articulate it more, in more clear terms. But it’s also, you know, actually trying to do some things in line with that as well. Some of the activities and events we have, you know, we’re running, it’s kind of in this distributed format. So different organisations across London, who are sort of value aligned across the sector, who might have their own communities, their own publics, can run things – different types of events, you know, engaging people in different ways. And then, you know, all together, we think, sort of the sum of the parts of doing these things across a week, in this distributed format, testing different engagement methods, you know, not only sort of builds a community of organisations around these, like common values, but also lets us, you know, actually reach out to the public, you know, the public with all the different people in London, from different backgrounds, there are so many different communities, you know, as much as possible, to connect to different communities and make them part of the conversation about how we use data and AI and in ways that they kind of historically haven’t been. Not just for data and AI, for lots of other things. But, you know, we know that these technologies are going to be so important for the future. And it’s, you know, designing events and activities that can try and ensure that they’re sort of have a, you know, a seat at the table, thinking about what that future is.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah. And you mentioned there a range of events. Jen, can you give us a flavour of some of the events coming up, the highlights, things that you might personally be most looking forward to?</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Ding</strong><br>
Yeah, happy to Brian. And maybe something to add to is something Sam and I were really hoping to go for is to not have, you know, maybe the typical talk or panel style format for all of our events that might be really common in a conference, but rather have different kinds of events that can focus on different kinds of activities. So having public conversations and debates, having exhibits and experiences, having resident or citizen science opportunities where people can actually be a part of creating data, and also learning opportunities if people want to upskill or learn about a concept. So to shout out some of the events I’m really excited for, maybe to start with the more wacky ones first. The Turing is hosting a “Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas” which will be a comedy show at the Camden Club where they will dig into topics like technology and data, but over a pint and through humour. So apparently, this is an 18+ show. So that might give you a little bit of a flavour of what’s to come. Another event we’re really excited about is an event called All the Docks, where a team of cyclists attempt this challenge in one day to hit every single Santander bike dock. They’ve done it before, and this year for London Data Week, they’re doing a round to hit, I think, the now over 800 docks that now exist in London. And this time, for London Data Week, what they’re also doing is making it a data collection exercise. So as they cross the streets of London, they’ll collect data on the road conditions, the cycling infrastructure, which can be then an open data set that people can use after the event as well. So those are two that jumped to mind. I don’t know, Sam, if there’s anything you want to highlight, or Brian because I know there’s a really exciting on that the RSS is…</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah, I’ll put a quick plug in for the, so <a href="https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/statisticians-for-society-london-data-week/#fulleventinfo">the Royal Statistical Society are organising an event associated with our Statisticians for Society initiative</a>, which offers pro bono support to charities under a million turnover in the UK. So I can, I’ll post a link in the show notes so that people can find out more about that and sign up if they meet the criteria and are interested in taking part. But Sam, sorry, I, I hijacked there. But go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Nutt</strong><br>
No, Brian, I was going to only mention your event. But no, a couple of others, I think just to show the like breadth of the types of activities. So you know, for example, it’s also it’s about partnering with organisations who are thinking and you know, already doing things like this, so the Science Gallery, for example, there’s– they’ve got an exhibition called “AI: Who’s looking after me?”, which is, you know, looks at some of the playful ways that AI is already involved in people’s lives and brings sort of people on a critical journey. That’s more of that sort of art exhibition type thing. In local government, where, in LOTI, we’re helping some boroughs with developing basically, a toolkit, a resource to help officers in boroughs in some of the data teams, who maybe haven’t had that history of engaging with residents, as seen as more sort of technical back office staff, actually, you know, give them the confidence to go out and have a conversation with residents about some of their practice and see how they can improve it. So there’s been a lot of interest there, in particular, around having conversations about how we do data linkage better, which, you know, in some ways, feels– it’s quite a straightforward data topic. But actually, the huge thing is that these teams in boroughs have never thought, we need to speak with residents at the design stage of data projects, you know, the public, what might a digitally excluded, relatively low sort of data literacy person be able to tell us about our data work that’s helpful to me as, you know, a data scientist, that was sort of some of the historical thinking, but actually, we’re sort of bringing boroughs on the journey of thinking, actually realising, you know, the value of doing that. So that’s sort of, I guess, the range of types of things as well.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Fantastic. So where, if people do want to sign up for any of these events, is there a good way for them to do that? Is it go to the LOTI website– not LOTI website, the London Data Week website, I’m guessing?</p>

There is a good amount of info on both the Turing and the LOTI website, but the best place we’d suggest is <a href="https://www.londondataweek.org/">londondataweek.org</a>. There you’ll find a list of events. And if you click on an event, there’s more information. And also, if you click “Find out more”, you can access a link for more information on how you express interest or sign up.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Excellent. And if people– when we’re speaking, we are almost exactly a month away from London Data Week. If someone’s listening to this and they think, Oh, I’ve got a great idea for an event I want to organise, is it too late for them to squeeze onto the programme now? Should they get in touch somehow if, if inspiration strikes?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Nutt</strong><br>
We’ll never say never. Probably there is a very late point in which we would say never. I think realistically, you know, the way it’s being run, it’s being run often with the time of volunteers and this sort of thing. And it is sort of the first year of us running it. So a lot of it’s coming through, through Jen and I. So if you are interested in running something, please do reach out to us. You know, we’ve got very good, Jen and I, at finding creative ways to slot people into programs and this sort of thing. But equally I think at this point, it’s really more about you know, bringing together people and organisations who are interested and actually, you know, I think we’ve got a really good exciting, fun set of events and activities across London that would be great to be part of even if you yourself haven’t been able to organise something, and then maybe it’s something for next year, for London Data Week 2024. Fingers crossed, we might be able to do something there.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So the stress of day jobs and organising a week-long event, or week-long collection of activities, hasn’t put you off doing it again? No.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Ding</strong><br>
So far, so good, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Nutt</strong><br>
Yeah, we’ll “no comment” some of that.</p>
<p><strong>Jennifer Ding</strong><br>
We’re definitely really excited though. And if anyone does have an idea or wants to start a conversation, there’s a contact form on our website, drop us an email. <a href="https://twitter.com/londondataweek">We also have a Twitter</a> if you want to send us a message through that. So at the very least, we love, we’d love to chat.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Great, well, we’ll put all those contact details, social media accounts, etc., into the show notes so people can find you. But thank you very much for joining us today. I know this must be a very busy time for you. But Sam Nutt, Jennifer Ding, thank you for joining us and talking about the upcoming London Data Week. I’m looking forward to it.</p>

  <title>No, AI probably won’t kill us all – and there’s more to this fear campaign than meets the eye</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Doomsaying is an old occupation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a complex subject. It’s easy to fear what you don’t understand. These three truths go some way towards explaining the oversimplification and dramatisation plaguing discussions about AI.</p>
<p>Last week, outlets around the world were plastered with news of yet another <a href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk">open letter claiming</a> AI poses an existential threat to humankind. This letter, published through the nonprofit Center for AI Safety, has been signed by industry figureheads including <a href="https://theconversation.com/ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-says-ai-is-a-new-form-of-intelligence-unlike-our-own-have-we-been-getting-it-wrong-this-whole-time-204911">Geoffrey Hinton</a> and the chief executives of Google DeepMind, Open AI and Anthropic.</p>
<p>However, I’d argue a healthy dose of scepticism is warranted when considering the AI doomsayer narrative. Upon close inspection, we see there are commercial incentives to manufacture fear in the AI space.</p>
<p>And as a researcher of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it seems to me the framing of AI as an existential threat has more in common with 17th-century philosophy than computer science.</p>
<section id="was-chatgpt-a-breakthrough" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="was-chatgpt-a-breakthrough">Was ChatGPT a ‘breakthrough’?</h2>
<p>When ChatGPT was released late last year, people were delighted, entertained and horrified.</p>
<p>But ChatGPT isn’t a research breakthrough as much as it is a product. The technology it is based on is several years old. An early version of its underlying model, GPT-3, was released in 2020 with many of the same capabilities. It just wasn’t easily accessible online for everyone to play with.</p>
<p>Back in 2020 and 2021, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9495946">I</a> and many <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09548-1">others</a> wrote papers discussing the capabilities and shortcomings of GPT-3 and similar models – and the world carried on as always. Forward to today, and ChatGPT has had an incredible impact on society. What changed?</p>
<p>In March, Microsoft researchers <a href="https://futurism.com/gpt-4-sparks-of-agi">published a paper</a> claiming GPT-4 showed “sparks of artificial general intelligence”. AGI is the subject of a variety of competing definitions, but for the sake of simplicity can be understood as AI with human-level intelligence.</p>
<p>Some immediately interpreted the Microsoft research as saying GPT-4 <em>is</em> an AGI. By the definitions of AGI I’m familiar with, this is certainly not true. Nonetheless, it added to the hype and furore, and it was hard not to get caught up in the panic. Scientists are no more immune to <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-36822-7">group think</a> than anyone else.</p>
<p>The same day that paper was submitted, The Future of Life Institute <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">published an open letter</a> calling for a six-month pause on training AI models more powerful than GPT-4, to allow everyone to take stock and plan ahead. Some of the AI luminaries who signed it expressed concern that AGI poses an existential threat to humans, and that ChatGPT is too close to AGI for comfort.</p>
<p>Soon after, prominent AI safety researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky – who has been commenting on the dangers of superintelligent AI <a href="https://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf">since well before</a> 2020 – took things a step further. <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">He claimed</a> we were on a path to building a “superhumanly smart AI”, in which case “the obvious thing that would happen” is “literally everyone on Earth will die”. He even suggested countries need to be willing to risk nuclear war to enforce compliance with AI regulation across borders.</p>
</section>
<section id="i-dont-consider-ai-an-imminent-existential-threat" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-dont-consider-ai-an-imminent-existential-threat">I don’t consider AI an imminent existential threat</h2>
<p>One aspect of AI safety research is to address potential dangers AGI might present. It’s a difficult topic to study because there is little agreement on what intelligence is and how it functions, let alone what a superintelligence might entail. As such, researchers must rely as much on speculation and philosophical argument as on evidence and mathematical proof.</p>
<p>There are two reasons I’m not concerned by ChatGPT and its <a href="https://lablab.ai/blog/what-is-babyagi-and-how-can-i-benefit-from-it">byproducts</a>.</p>
<p>First, it isn’t even close to the sort of artificial superintelligence that might conceivably pose a threat to humankind. The models underpinning it are slow learners that require immense volumes of data to construct anything akin to the versatile concepts humans can concoct from only a few examples. In this sense, it is not “intelligent”.</p>
<p>Second, many of the more catastrophic AGI scenarios depend on premises I find implausible. For instance, there seems to be a prevailing (but unspoken) assumption that sufficient intelligence amounts to limitless real-world power. If this was true, more scientists would be billionaires.</p>
<p>Moreover, cognition as we understand it in humans takes place as part of a physical environment (which includes our bodies), and this environment imposes limitations. The concept of AI as a “software mind” unconstrained by hardware has more in common with 17th-century <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/">dualism</a> (the idea that the mind and body are separable) than with contemporary theories of the mind existing as <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/">part of the physical world</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-the-sudden-concern" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-the-sudden-concern">Why the sudden concern?</h2>
<p>Still, doomsaying is old hat, and the events of the last few years probably haven’t helped – but there may be more to this story than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Among the prominent figures calling for AI regulation, many work for or have ties to incumbent AI companies. This technology is useful, and there is money and power at stake – so fearmongering presents an opportunity.</p>
<p>Almost everything involved in building ChatGPT has been published in research anyone can access. OpenAI’s competitors can (and have) replicated the process, and it won’t be long before free and open-source alternatives flood the market.</p>
<p>This point was made clearly in a memo <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">purportedly leaked</a> from Google entitled “We have no moat, and neither does OpenAI”. A moat is jargon for a way to secure your business against competitors.</p>
<p>Yann LeCun, who leads AI research at Meta, says these models should be open since they will become public infrastructure. He and many others are <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/completely-ridiculous-metas-chief-ai-scientist-yann-lecun-dismisses-elon-musks-civilisation-destruction-fear-383371-2023-05-30">unconvinced by the AGI doom</a> narrative.</p>

<p>Notably, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/05/meta-mark-zuckerberg-not-invited-ai-meeting-white-house/">Meta wasn’t invited</a> when US President Joe Biden recently met with the leadership of Google DeepMind and OpenAI. That’s despite the fact that Meta is almost certainly a leader in AI research; it produced PyTorch, the machine-learning framework OpenAI used to make GPT-3.</p>
<p>At the White House meetings, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman suggested the US government should issue licences to those who are trusted to responsibly train AI models. Licences, as Stability AI chief executive Emad Mostaque <a href="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1658653142429450242?s=20">puts it</a>, “are a kinda moat”.</p>
<p>Companies such as Google, OpenAI and Microsoft have everything to lose by allowing small, independent competitors to flourish. Bringing in licensing and regulation would help cement their position as market leaders and hamstring competition before it can emerge.</p>
<p>While regulation is appropriate in some circumstances, regulations that are rushed through will favour incumbents and suffocate small, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2023/04/19/amid-growing-call-to-pause-ai-research-laion-petitions-governments-to-keep-agi-research-open-active-and-responsible/?sh=1b21161a62e3">free and open-source competition</a>.</p>

  <title>What’s the future of data science and AI in an LLM world?</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/05/26/future.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The impact ChatGPT and large language models (LLMs) are having on the practice and profession of data science is something <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/05/11/chatgpt-data-science-pt1.html">we discussed recently with data scientists from Unilever, BT, Deliveroo, and others</a>. So, it was interesting to hear a perspective this week from Osama Rahman, director of the <a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/">Data Science Campus</a> at the UK Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>Speaking Tuesday at <a href="https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/local-groups/what-is-the-future-of-data-science-and-ai-online/">an online event</a>, Rahman mused on how LLMs brought both potential benefits and risks. For example, those who can already code can code more efficiently now with the help of LLM-powered tools. However, those same tools also allow non-coders to code – and inexpert use of tools and code presents risks. How do we guard against this, he was asked. “I don’t know,” came the response, “other than you have to observe and clampdown on it.”</p>
<p>Such problems are by no means new or unique to the post-ChatGPT era, of course. As someone with a background in economics, Rahman said he has, over the years, observed “inexpert uses of economics.” His advice was to “make sure experts are plugged in” – to teams, conversations, decision-making processes, etc. – “and are seen as the experts in the use of these tools.”</p>
<p>The discussion was wide-ranging, and also took in questions on whether data scientists have the right skills at this moment – “Skills evolve, it’s just a natural process… We need to keep a culture of curiosity…” – and whether enough is being done to address ethical issues – “My key issue is that ethical frameworks need a lot more discussion and debate than it takes to put out a new tool… I don’t have much to add, other than that there is a problem.”</p>
<p>However, two questions – and answers – jumped out at me as particularly interesting. Rahman was asked: Have we delivered on the promise of data science from 5 years ago? “No, but that’s because expectations were wrong,” he said. “Data science wasn’t going to completely and utterly transform government. But where it has delivered is in an evolving set of tools, people, and skills coming in and allowing us to do impactful stuff. It hasn’t delivered on the false promise that it would change the world, but it has delivered a lot.”</p>
<p>He was also asked: How will data science and AI have changed the world in 5–10 years? “I’m not sure it will,” he said. “It will do certain things. It will allow us to address certain analytical problems more efficiently.” Rahman then offered a salutary reminder. Email once made life more efficient; now, we’re all at risk of “death by email.”</p>
<p>We’ll be sure to update this post with a link to a video or other recording of the event, if/when it becomes available. For now, be sure to check out our two-part discussion on LLMs and data science:</p>

<p>I would probably call myself more on the analyst side. So, while my day-to-day job doesn’t necessarily involve AI, ML and productionalising models, it’s more taking business goals or requirements and taking the data and essentially bridging the gap between the two. I am on the incrementality analytics team. So, what that means is I measure the short-term returns from our marketing efforts that we have. And I do that via geotesting. So, I’m essentially working in the geotesting part of the company if you like. And before that I worked in the customer data section. So, essentially looking at customer data and working with that.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-long-have-you-been-working-in-data-science">How long have you been working in data science?</h3>
<p>More in an analyst role, but probably about seven years now, I began in Stack Overflow just as a data analyst, and then worked at DAZN – which is like a Netflix for sports – as a data analyst, and then joined here as a senior analyst, and then moved into data science in the last couple of years. I would, I would credit Stack Overflow as the place where my career kind of was birthed, if you like. I started there as an account manager, so with hardly any technical background at all required, and then moved into a role that was essentially looking after, or reporting the metrics of advertising campaigns for companies that would advertise on Stack Overflow. So that required a little technical knowledge, not much – a few pivot tables and things like that. But then the longer I stayed there, the further my career developed, and they had, at the time – probably still do – some fantastically smart people that work there, as you can imagine. I was sponsored to do a General Assembly data analytics course, which was focused around Excel, dashboarding, and SQL and essentially fell in love with data analysis. It was the most technical subject matter that I had experienced to that point, and I found a real natural affinity to it, particularly SQL. And then [I] moved into more of a data analyst role within Stack Overflow, so – as you can probably imagine – an absolute sea of proprietary data that needed analysing, and started learning R, or rather being taught R within Stack Overflow, and loved it. I think I was there for three-and-a-half years, and then moved into a data analyst role at DAZN. At this point, I did a data science General Assembly bootcamp course, and fell in love with that. And then I decided that I really loved General Assembly as a concept; I actually started a second job teaching there, so the courses that I had previously taken I was now teaching, first as a teaching assistant, and then as a lead instructor, which was one of the most, yeah, one of the most amazing experiences I’ve had actually, I learned a lot from that. And then I got a job as a senior analyst within Expedia Group, which is where I am now, and then moved into a data science role, which is what I’m doing currently. So, I actually left school at 16, and had to go into a full-time employment. And the General Assembly education that I took a part in was my first of that type. So, when I realised that data science was absolutely something that I really wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to, I decided to take on a part-time data science bachelor’s degree, which I am now about a year away from finishing. Because I’m doing it part time it takes a bit longer. But yeah, so I will have my data science bachelor’s completed, hopefully, by 2024.</p>

<p>There were two big inspirations into getting into data sciences. So, they were actually the data scientists that I worked with at Stack Overflow. They were the first two data scientists, I believe, that Stack Overflow had ever hired. I worked very closely with them as an analyst and one of them was, had previously worked – I don’t know if it was officially an astrophysicist – but had studied black holes, and I remember thinking that was just amazing. And the other was, was very famous within the field. And they spent a lot of time giving me one-on-one training on R and SQL and basic analysis, and I was so inspired by these two individuals that I, it was also a career path that I didn’t really know existed.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-data-science-mean-to-you">What does data science mean to you?</h3>
<p>For me, it is bridging the gap between the business requirements and the data that businesses have. So, you’ll have business goals, requirements that kind of come down the line and there’s a lot of data that’s being collected, and, essentially, you have to try and be the bridge between the two. So, not just doing very complicated analyses, with very sophisticated models – at least not in my role – it’s about being able to create analysis that’s interpretable, that you can present to non-technical stakeholders that they’re going to understand to a degree. So, I do know that in different roles in different companies, it will be slightly different. But yeah, for me, it’s about making data, yeah, interpretable, to the non-technical stakeholders to enable them to do their job better.</p>

<p>I like to think that there is one responsibility around how statistics are interpreted. So, just making sure that when you’re giving someone a statistic, that they understand what it can be used for, what it can’t be used for, and that it doesn’t kind of get halfway around the company before, you know, without any danger of it being misinterpreted. And I do think that the other is just being a translator. So, as well as teaching with General Assembly, I teach people within my company, things like SQL, R, and some basic data analysis. And I feel like it’s taking what is quite a technical, complicated subject and almost translating it into, if you like, English, so that people can kind of get some sense of what something may mean, without necessarily having to have the degree to back it up.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-hurdles-did-you-face-in-becoming-a-data-scientist">What hurdles did you face in becoming a data scientist?</h3>
<p>Towards the beginning of my career to say – 5, 6 years ago – it was quite hard to get interviews. It was never hard to get interviews with technical people within companies, because you can– a technical person can see whether or not you know what you’re talking about. But recruiters don’t, and if someone is a recruiter for a technical role, their proxy for whether or not you can do the role is what’s your level of education, which is completely understandable and that’s what education is for. But it did mean that sometimes I applied for roles that were well below my, my level, and if I did so through a recruiter, then I wouldn’t hear anything back. But if I spoke to a technical person within that company, then it would be fine.</p>

<section id="how-did-you-overcome-those-hurdles" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-did-you-overcome-those-hurdles">How did you overcome those hurdles?</h3>
<p>Actually, I guess the story of how I joined Expedia is quite relevant in that way. So, I presented some, just some fun analysis that I did at an R-Ladies meetup, and I was already talking to a recruiter within Expedia Group and I said to them, oh, well, I happen to be visiting your offices to present at this meetup, so maybe I can meet you there. And they actually sent the manager of the team that they wanted me to join. So, this manager attended the meetup, watched me present, and then they ended up hiring me, which is really great. But I do really think that that was a result of being able to see me on stage, talking about stuff that I had done, showing code that I had written, and it kind of bypassed a few steps. So yeah, I would definitely say meetups and connections are very helpful to overcome that.</p>

<p>I think that what was impressed upon me in that first year – and what really drove me to do the bootcamp courses and then, ultimately, the degree – above everything, actually, was the importance of statistics and interpreting statistics in a way that’s honest. So, I feel like– I feel like with coding, that comes quite naturally to me, and writing SQL queries, R, that was all kind of fine. That didn’t require a lot. But I really, I had an amazing manager who taught me a lot about, essentially, if you’re going to go and speak to this company about the campaign that they’ve run on our website, then you need to impress that X doesn’t necessarily mean Y, it just gives evidence to, or alludes to, and essentially just making sure that how you’re communicating things is as accurate as possible.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="any-mistakes-or-regrets-in-your-career-so-far">Any mistakes or regrets in your career so far?</h3>
<p>When I look back on my career, I think the things that have really stayed with me that I’ve really learned from, mistakes wise, are around small little mistakes around how you interpret data. Maybe it was a, like, years ago, summing the wrong cell in Excel but not checking two or three or four times before that goes out. I’m now quite– I over-check everything. I think that the most important part of our job, as well as being the translation, is being the correct translation. You need to be reliable. People need to know that if you put out analysis that they can trust you. So, I would say I regret every small, tiny little data error that I ever made, which I can’t even recall right now, but I know have kind of cumulated enough that it has made me a very fastidious checker, I suppose.</p>

<p>I definitely see myself being an individual contributor in a consumer-facing company, just because that is basically what I’ve been doing up to this point. I don’t really have any desire to get into people management. I very much love being stuck in a room with my laptop, solving problems. Above all else, it still makes me happy. However, I do also love knowledge sharing – I love teaching, whether it’s with General Assembly, or whether it’s within the company that I work now. And I would like to kind of balance those two goals moving forward. So, keeping my role within my company as like an individual contributor and actually being like the front face for the, for the analysis that’s happening rather than kind of managing it. But also making sure that I carve out time to upskill others, because data science as a field, I mean, as you all know, is growing so much and people are coming in from different backgrounds. And I’m lucky enough to be able to kind of speak to a few people like that and do some very casual mentorship. And it makes me happy to see, so I hope that as my career develops, I will see more people maybe with backgrounds a little bit more like mine, come through and bring some diversity to the sector.</p>

<p>It would be remiss of me to not mention like ChatGPT or generative AI, etc. But honestly, I am more interested in – or vaguely interested, I should say – in wearable technology. So, I’ve read a few very, very interesting papers and articles that talk about the development of wearable technology, not just your kind of watches, but potentially clothing, etc., that can be used for people with specific health problems to really help pinpoint, like, inflection points in time when something might happen. For example, a heart attack is about to happen, or is imminent, or is happening. So I actually feel like at the moment, this is perhaps going slightly under the radar, compared with more, you know, sexy developments like chatbots and things. But I’m very interested to see in the next one to two decades how ubiquitous wearables will be, and how closely entwined that will become with healthcare. So that’s something that I’m keeping half an eye on.</p>

<p>You will never stop learning at all because, frankly, the field is moving very, very quickly. So, even if you were to kind of consider yourself an absolute expert today, tomorrow that may not be the case. You will constantly be learning. And I have found that learning the same thing several times through different mediums and having things explained to you different ways is so valuable. Because you may think that you understand something from, say, your bootcamp, but then when you read about it as part of your degree – this is obviously personal to me – you read about it in a different way. And you think, Oh, I’ve never thought of it like that. And then you watch a YouTube video and someone visualises it and you think, okay, I understand this all a little bit deeper now. So, constantly revising what you do know and learning anything that’s new as it comes up, I think everyone at every stage of career can kind of, can do that.</p>

  <title>Large language models: Do we need to understand the maths, or simply recognise the limitations?</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/05/18/chatgpt-data-science-pt2.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/05/11/chatgpt-data-science-pt1.html">Part 1 of our conversation with the Royal Statistical Society’s Data Science and AI (DS&amp;AI) Section</a> ended on a discussion around the need to verify that large language models (LLMs), when embedded in workflows and operational processes, are working as intended. But there was also acknowledgement that this could be difficult to achieve, not least of all because, as Giles Pavey said, “nobody knows exactly how these things work – not even the people who build them.” And then, of course, there is the speed at which developments are taking place: Trevor Duguid Farrant made the point that an expert may not even have a chance to finish reviewing the latest version of an LLM before a new iteration is rolled out.</p>
<p>These issues – of verification, explainability and interpretability – are of particular interest to data scientists like Anjali Mazumder, whose work focuses on the impact AI technologies could have, and are having, on society and individuals.</p>
<p>In part 2 of our Q&amp;A about ChatGPT and other LLM-powered advances, and what all of this might mean for data science, Mazumder kicks off the conversation by setting out her perspective.</p>
<p>Our full list of interviewees, in order of appearance, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anjali Mazumder</strong>, AI and Justice &amp; Human Rights Theme Lead at the Alan Turing Institute, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detlef Nauck</strong>, head of AI and data science research at BT, and editorial board member, Real World Data Science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Martin Goodson</strong>, CEO and chief scientist at Evolution AI, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Louisa Nolan</strong>, head of public health data science, Public Health Wales, and DS&amp;AI secretary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Piers Stobbs</strong>, VP science at Deliveroo, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trevor Duguid Farrant</strong>, senior principal statistician at Mondelez International, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Giles Pavey</strong>, global director for data science at Unilever, and DS&amp;AI vice-chair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adam Davison</strong>, head of data science at the Advertising Standards Authority, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Anjali Mazumder:</strong> I work in research, but I also sit in the crux of government, industry, and civil society, looking at how they’re using these technologies. For me, it’s about knowing what the opportunities are but also understanding the limitations, the risks and the harms, and how we balance those and put in place oversight mechanisms that act as safeguards to ensure that these technologies don’t cause harm. We’re taking a very socio-technical approach that requires an interdisciplinary team to understand these issues and what should be done. Part of this is about not only the outcomes and the impact but also the upstream side of it – recognising that these models have been built on the work of people who have done the labelling, and that this also has implications – to say nothing of the associated environmental issues or energy issues!</p>
<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> I think the regulators really have to look at this. It has come completely out of left field for them. All the regulators that we are monitoring, they regulate the space as it was three years ago – they are mainly concerned about predictive models and bias. But if you look at, say, what Microsoft wants to do – putting GPT into Office 365 and into Bing – that will completely change how people interact with and consume information. I think the large tech companies really have a responsibility here, when they make this public, to make sure that people understand what this technology actually is, and how it can be used and has to be used.</p>
<p>Also, they need to open up about how these things have been built. There are a lot of stories around <a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/">how OpenAI used cheap labour in order to do the labelling and reinforcement learning for ChatGPT</a>, and these things have to become public knowledge; they need to become part of some kind of Kitemark for these models: “Ethically built, properly checked, hallucinate only a little bit. Whatever you do, don’t take it for granted. Check it!” That’s the kind of disclaimer they need to put on these models.</p>

<p><strong>Regulatory principles always seem to stress that AI systems should be understandable, and we should be able to explain how we get particular outputs. But a lot of our conversation has focused on how we don’t really know how these models work. So, is that, in itself, a problem, and is it something that the data science community can help with – to dig into how these things work and try and get that across – to help meet these principles of explainability and interpretability?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DN:</strong> That’s a very specialist job, I would say – specialist research into how these mathematical structures work. It’s not something I could do, and I’ve not seen any significant work there. One thing that we are interested in is whether we can do knowledge embedding, so that you can “teach” concepts that these models can then use to communicate, and that would lead to smaller systems where you have some understanding of what’s inside. But all of this kind of work, I think, is very much just beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> Do we actually need this? There’s sort of a big assumption there that you need to understand how LLMs work in order to build in the kinds of things that we care about as a society. But we don’t understand how humans think. Of course, we can ask a human, “Why did you make that decision?” You can’t understand the cause of that decision – that’s a complex neuroscience question. But you can ask what the reason is for making a decision, and you can ask an LLM what its reasoning is as well. I think a lot of these questions about explainability are stuck in the past, when you’re trying to explain how a linear model works. It’s really not the same thing when you’ve got an LLM where you can just say, “Why did you make that decision?”</p>
<p><strong>Louisa Nolan:</strong> I was going to say something very similar. Most people don’t know how most things work…</p>
<p><strong>DN:</strong> My point was, these things are largely still like the Improbability Drive in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>. You press a button, and you don’t really know what comes out, and that’s the problem we need to get our heads around.</p>
<p><strong>LN:</strong> But people don’t know what percentages are, and yet we still use them for decision making. I don’t think people need to understand the maths behind LLMs, and I think it would be a hopeless job to expect everybody to do that. What we do need to understand is what LLMs can and can’t do. What’s the body of work that they are drawing from? What isn’t in there? What are the things that you need to check? So, for some things, it’ll be brilliant: if you’ve written something and you want it rewritten for a nine-year-old; if you want to summarise a paper; if you want to write code, as long as you already know how to code – these could be real labour-saving tasks. If you’re using ChatGPT to write a thesis about something that you haven’t looked at, that’s where the danger is. It’s this kind of simple understanding that people need to get in their heads – and the maths, except for the people who care about it, is beside the point, and probably detrimental, because it means that people won’t engage with it.</p>
<p><strong>DN:</strong> I agree, but I wasn’t talking about the general public. I meant, the people who build these things – they should know what they’re doing.</p>

<p><strong>We talked there about communication. There was a webinar recently by the <a href="https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/groups/glasgow/">Royal Statistical Society’s Glasgow Local Group</a>, and the presenter, <a href="https://www.hannahrosekirk.com/">Hannah Rose Kirk</a>, showed how you can take tabular data and statistical results and ask ChatGPT to produce a nice paragraph or two that explains the numbers. Is this the sort of thing that any of you have experimented with? Have you had any successes at using ChatGPT to translate data into readable English that decision makers can act on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Piers Stobbs:</strong> I have an interesting use case. We had a basic survey: 200-odd responses, multiple languages, and we just said, “Please summarise the results of this survey contained in this CSV file.” And it came up with five or six relevant bullet points. What was amazing was that we could then interrogate it. For example, “Please compare the results that were in English versus in French, and describe the differences.” Again, it did it, but then you have the issue of, was it all correct? Well, the bulk of it was. Now I am intrigued by whether you can ask it to do correlations and some actual statistical things on a dataset, and does it get that right? I don’t know. We’ve not really got to that. But, to go back to one of the earlier discussion points around productivity, that initial survey work could have easily taken a week of someone’s time if we didn’t run it through ChatGPT.</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Duguid Farrant:</strong> Piers, in this case you’re interested in checking and seeing if it’s right. If you’d asked a group of people to do that survey for you and get the results, you’d have just accepted whatever they gave you back. You wouldn’t have questioned it.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> That’s true. And the results were plausible, certainly.</p>
<p><strong>AM:</strong> I think one of the challenges is that the results could seem like they’re plausible, right – whether that’s a statistical output or a text output. This was not a proper experiment, but I asked ChatGPT about colleagues and friends who are quite prominent researchers, asking, “Who is so-and-so?”, and it produced biographies that were quite plausibly them, but it wasn’t them. It might have listed the correct PhD, say, but the date was off by a year, or the date was correct but it was from the wrong institution. So, depending on what the issue is, these seemingly plausible results could have more serious implications.</p>
<p><strong>LN:</strong> So, just to join those two things together: for me, the question is not, “Do we understand how ChatGPT works?” As Martin says, we don’t understand how humans work, and surely we’re trying to develop something that enhances human thinking in some way. The more important question for me is, “How do we know that what is produced is useful?”</p>

<p><strong>Giles, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/05/11/chatgpt-data-science-pt1.html">you mentioned previously that you’re doing some work at Unilever around how to minimise hallucination</a>. I don’t know how much you can say on what direction that’s going in, and how successful you expect that to be, but that’s obviously going to be a really important part of refining these models to be more widely usable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giles Pavey:</strong> I’m by no means an expert, but there’s quite a lot you can do with both the architecture of it and also the pre-prompts that you put in – more or less saying, “Quote what the source is, and if you’re not sure, then tell me you’re not sure.” I think what’s interesting is the question of whether we’ll have to rely on OpenAI or Microsoft to do that work, and it will be just another thing that we have to trust them for. Or, will it be something that people within an organisation can put in themselves?</p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> I think it’s absolutely critical that open-source models are developed that can compete with these tech companies, otherwise there’s going to be a huge transfer of power to these companies.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Arguably, the single biggest issue is, who elected Sam Altman (no-one) and are we as society happy with him having so much power over our future?</p>
<p><strong>To close us out, I’d like to return to <a href="http://localhost:5404/careers/posts/2023/05/11/chatgpt-data-science-pt1.html">a question Trevor posed earlier</a>, which is: How might organisations like the Royal Statistical Society help companies to embrace LLMs and start using them, so that everyone can benefit from the technology?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adam Davison:</strong> My instinct is that there’s some great parallel here with the stuff that the Data Science and AI Section have been doing in general, where we’ve said, “OK, there’s lots of good advice out there on how to do things in data science, but how do you make it practical? How do you make it real? How do you apply those ethical principles? How do you make sure you have people with the right technical understanding in charge of projects to get value?” If, five years ago, the hype around data science was leading organisations to hire 100 data scientists in the hope that something innovative would happen, well then, we don’t want those same organisations now thinking that they need to hire 100 prompt engineers and keep their fingers crossed for something special. Our focus has been on “<a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/newsletter/">industrial strength data science</a>”, so I think we can extend that to show what “industrial strength LLM usage” looks like in practice.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>For many people, it starts with a question. Something simple, something they already know the answer to. A test, in other words, to see what these AI-powered chatbots are all about. But spend any amount of time with ChatGPT and other such tools and you’ll quickly start to wonder what else they might do, and how useful they might be in your day-to-day working life.</p>
<p>Data scientists certainly have been thinking along these lines, and to find out more about current use cases, proofs of concepts and potential applications, Real World Data Science got together with members of the <a href="https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/data-science-section/">Royal Statistical Society’s Data Science and AI Section</a> (DS&amp;AI) for a group discussion.</p>
<p>Our interviewees, in order of appearance, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Piers Stobbs</strong>, VP science at Deliveroo, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</li>
<li><strong>Detlef Nauck</strong>, head of AI and data science research at BT, and editorial board member, Real World Data Science.</li>
<li><strong>Adam Davison</strong>, head of data science at the Advertising Standards Authority, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</li>
<li><strong>Trevor Duguid Farrant</strong>, senior principal statistician at Mondelez International, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</li>
<li><strong>Giles Pavey</strong>, global director for data science at Unilever, and DS&amp;AI vice-chair.</li>
<li><strong>Martin Goodson</strong>, CEO and chief scientist at Evolution AI, and DS&amp;AI committee member.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first part of our discussion focuses on how large language models are becoming part of the data science toolkit, and what this new development means for data science teams and skillsets. Stay tuned for part two, which we’ll be publishing soon!</p>
<p>(<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Part two is now published: <a href="../../../../../careers/posts/2023/05/18/chatgpt-data-science-pt2.html">“Large language models: Do we need to understand the maths, or simply recognise the limitations?”</a>)</p>

</div>
<p><strong>As data scientists, how has ChatGPT – and other tools built on large language models (LLMs) – changed your working lives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Piers Stobbs:</strong> Up to about a year ago, although I was really impressed with the developments in deep learning and the improvements in computer vision and natural language models, it felt in line with general improvements in machine learning. And then, probably about six months ago, with things like DALL·E and ChatGPT, it felt like something changed – properly ground-breaking capabilities. And I still can’t quite get my head around the fact that you can basically have a model that tries to predict the next token, and it comes up with outputs that really feel quite sensible and human-like – if prone to <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2022/11/23/LLM-content-warning.html">hallucination</a>.</p>
<p>The way I think about it is, this feels like a brand-new capability that we’ve just not really had before. It’s almost like an interface with unstructured information. Historically, you sort of have to turn text into something, and then turn something back into text, if you want to have this interface with humans. Now, we’ve got this really quite elegant way of plugging the gaps, which feels full of opportunities.</p>
<p>I’m having great fun playing around with the code co-pilots – GitHub’s Copilot is amazing and, productivity wise, is helping me a lot. I am now a much faster coder because there’s all those Stack Exchange lookups that I don’t have to do anymore. Again, from a personal productivity perspective, I’m using [ChatGPT] for initial drafts of documents and other things. And then I use it almost for validating things. For instance, I had a random discussion the other night with ChatGPT about logistic algorithms. It’s not going to solve problems for you, but I asked it to give some pointers of things I could be thinking about – some of which I had, some of which I hadn’t. So, it’s almost like a brainstorming helper, somehow.</p>
<p>But probably the thing I’m most excited about is the knowledge sharing side of it – plugging it into, or on top of, private information, and surfacing all that knowledge that is locked away in documents and intranet pages.</p>

<p><strong>Detlef Nauck:</strong> We’re looking into running proof of concepts to see whether LLMs do bring value. Software engineering is the most obvious one, and easiest to set up and run. And then we want to look at making use of internal documents – so, either summarization or creation of internal documents in appropriate language. The latter use cases are trickier to evaluate. We want to know whether the outputs produced are any good. With software engineering you can track GitHub statistics, for example. But if you give ChatGPT to somebody to write marketing material, or to get information out of a document, how do you know that the results are good? We need to get our head around metrics for evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Davison:</strong> I’ve been using it for basically anything where I don’t remember the API very well or it’s a bit confusing. <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> is the key, right? We all use pandas, but you don’t really remember how to do some complicated thing with <code>apply()</code>, say, so you just ask GPT-4 to give you the answer, and it saves you that hassle. Also, I read some insightful tweet that said these chat systems are really good for things where generating the solution is hard, but verifying it is easy. And I think that’s true for some of these things. You know, you get a short piece of Python code, you can basically look at that and you can tell if it’s right.</p>
<p>In data science, you’re a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. You need to do little bits of everything, but you’re not a specialist in anything. And so, I think for software development, it’s been really helpful. For example, right now, I’m doing a bit of frontend development in a project to visualise something. I’m never going to be a professional frontend developer, but GPT-4 can help deal with the oddities of JavaScript much more easily than it would be for me to trawl through Stack Overflow posts.</p>
<p>But the thing that we’re using it for, practically, is natural language processing (NLP) and classification. We have this particular problem at the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) where we are running lots of different models that are completely unconnected to each other because every project is a different topic. So, one week we’re looking at, “Do these gambling ads appeal to young people?” and then the week after it’s, “Are these cryptocurrency ads being clear about the risks involved?” It’s very disparate, we don’t have a lot of time to iterate on models, and we don’t have huge amounts of training data. Ten years ago, when you were doing sentiment classification, you were on Mechanical Turk getting 10,000 examples, and even then it didn’t work very well after these really complicated models. Now, you’ve got a couple of hundred examples and with the embeddings [from LLMs] you can get to a pretty decent classifier quite quickly. We’re also starting to experiment with using OpenAI’s fine-tuning tools, and the performance that we’ve seen from that is very impressive, to the extent that it’s making us rethink whether we bother doing anything else in some of our classifiers.</p>

<p>Five years ago, if you had a sophisticated problem involving text or images, you’d need a big research team with a big budget to tackle it. But increasingly we find, like many other people, that you can take models off the shelf and repurpose them for quite diverse tasks.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p><strong>Trevor Duguid Farrant:</strong> My organisation is not as far forward as the rest of you. I’ve introduced it to the leadership team, and the digital services team – what was IT – are looking to make a decision on whether we can use it or not. I think there’ll be so much pressure they’ll have to use it, but there’s still a feeling of discomfort with it, whereas I think it’s really good and have started using it. Everyone else on the call seems to have started using it. So, can organisations like the Royal Statistical Society help companies to embrace this and start using it, and then everyone can benefit from it?</p>
<p><strong>Giles Pavey:</strong> I wish I could be with Piers and Adam – actually using it – but my life has been taken over as the guy who goes and explains it to the business. Unilever is a massive business, and we are concerned about privacy, confidentiality and trustworthiness. We’ve now built an initial GPT instance on Azure and fed it with some of our own documents, and a lot of my time has been working with legal to convince ourselves that that’s okay. Now we are really trying to work out just how we manage the amazing demand for proofs of concepts and use cases – and what we’re just about to uncover, I think, is the unknown but potentially massive expense of running it.</p>
<p>In pure proofs of concepts, departments that have large knowledge banks are using it: research and development, and marketing, for example. And one of the big technical things that we’re working on – and, because of the size that we are, we’re doing a lot of work with OpenAI and Microsoft on this – is how to stop the models from hallucinating.</p>
<p><strong>Have your experiences with ChatGPT and other tools changed your thinking about the skillsets required of data scientists and data science teams?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> A little bit. As someone at a small organisation, I think it’s quite exciting because, five years ago, maybe you were in a world where if you had a sophisticated problem involving text or images, you’d need a big research team with a big budget to tackle it. But increasingly we find, like many other people, that you can take models off the shelf and repurpose them for quite diverse tasks. So, I think it’s becoming increasingly viable to have a small team of people who are implementers, who aren’t necessarily backed up by a big research organisation, doing increasingly sophisticated stuff.</p>
<p>I don’t think it does away with the sort of things that we always bang on about in the Data Science and AI Section, like the need for an understanding of statistics and how the underlying systems really work, because I think you still need to understand what you’re doing with LLMs, as with any other machine learning technique. But, if I had to guess, what we’re going to be seeing now is that for a lot of problems, you’re going to have more of a division – so, you’re either in one of a small number of very large labs doing research on very cutting-edge big models, or you can be an implementer who is taking things off the shelf and applying them. And maybe that space in between is going to get a little bit squeezed – that would be my guess, but obviously it’s very unpredictable.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> That’s exactly my view. When I first started hiring data scientists, a long time ago, you basically had to write stuff from scratch, and you needed PhDs – people who really understood, at a deep level, how the maths all works. But I think there’s been a steady progression towards valuing software engineering skills, and I think, in some ways, this is another step along that path. If I think now about implementing a chatbot over your own knowledge base, it’s basically like plugging APIs together with some Python. Adam’s point is still hugely important, though, because I think we still need the background knowledge about what’s actually going on – OK, I’m creating embeddings here, and that’s allowing this search to work so I can surface the right docs – that whole process, which an average software engineer is maybe not going to know. But I think it’s definitely blurring the lines.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Goodson:</strong> It’s just as important now to understand how to evaluate performance. The difference is, it used to be that you were trying to figure out whether it’s 80% accurate, or 85%. Now, it’s like 99.9%. But you still need to figure it out. You still need to understand what the failure modes are, what caused it; how is it actually working, and is it doing what you need it to do for the product? Is it actually satisfying our needs as users or as customers of the products.</p>
<p><strong>DN:</strong> I think in the future, the skills we will need are people who can run and build these models. Giles made the point about how expensive it is to run these things. Right now, you have two options: subscribe to an API, and then you are limited in how you can modify these models; or build your own – take an open-source LLM and modify it. But then you need people who know how to build a high-performance computing environment and operate this efficiently. You need to know how to actually train the models, how to curate the data, how to set the model parameters. And I always think there’s too much alchemy still going on in this field, right? It’s not proper science. People build these things and then are surprised at what they can do; they didn’t know such things would be possible. A lot of these capabilities only emerge when you make the models really, really big and, essentially, you also have no control over them – you can’t stop them hallucinating. So, these are the kinds of issues we need to get under control if we want to get any value out of them.</p>
<p>Prompt engineering is another one – you really need to understand how these models work and how to prompt them. If you want to give them to, say, a marketer to generate copywriting, they may not have the right ideas of how to prompt the machine. So, I could see roles developing out of data science that understand how to influence these models and make them do what we want them to do.</p>
<p><strong>MG:</strong> The other angle to this is junior engineers. Now, the bar for being a useful junior engineer is that you’re better than GitHub Copilot. Why do you need a really junior person if you can just use a large language model to be the junior developer?</p>
<p><strong>DN:</strong> I’m not thinking about the data science person who needs to write some code for a project here, but if you have a large software team in an organisation that produces production code, they will become more efficient by using these tools. But still, with all this overhead of testing and putting it all together, there will be a lot of manual work that needs to be done. But the teams will get more efficient and junior people will get up to speed quicker. That’s probably another advantage.</p>

<p>Can the Royal Statistical Society help non-tech companies embrace large language models, extolling their virtues and dispelling the myths?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> I think Detlef’s point about understanding is an interesting one. It definitely feels like there’s been this sort of continuum from, you know, “OK, it’s a linear regression, we know what’s going on” to complex models to ensemble models where, again, you’re combining these things you can individually understand. Even with big ImageNet architectures, billions of parameters, at least conceptually you can understand how these work and build out tools where you can understand the layers. To me, what’s different now is you’ve got this reinforcement learning layer on top, or diffusion layer, or some other additional approach – this combination of really complicated things. I honestly don’t know where to start with trying to understand why a specific output is generated, and I think that is a proper concern. That’s definitely an area of research, because I think we need to understand this.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> I think there’s also a question in large companies of just who owns these things. Up until this point, everybody’s been happy that AI is the realm of data science. And, suddenly, generative AI looks like it might be the realm of the IT team – that it’s a service that you get off the shelf. It’s going to be interesting to see how that plays out. I really liked the point that Martin was making about being able to tell what the systems are actually doing, what they are supposed to do and how to check them, because if you don’t have a background in that area, you might just assume they work. Now, nobody knows exactly how these things work – not even the people who build them. But having a background in how you test things, for potential causes for things not working, is actually going to be incredibly powerful or useful.</p>
<p><strong>TDF:</strong> Will experts like us actually be able to check it because of the speed that new versions are coming out and the developments that are happening? Is it going to take us six months to check that GPT-3.5 works? Well, too late, a month later GPT-4’s out! I just think that pace is going to keep accelerating.</p>

<p>We’re about a year late coming to <a href="https://www.harebrain.co/">Stephanie Hare</a>’s book, <a href="https://londonpublishingpartnership.co.uk/technology-is-not-neutral/"><em>Technology is Not Neutral: A Short Guide to Technology Ethics</em></a>. But, as discussed in our interview below, time has only made the text more relevant. The book was written pre-ChatGPT, but Hare’s explorations of ethical questions in the context of facial recognition technology and Covid-19 exposure tracking apps feel both pointed and urgent at this moment, when researchers, regulators, and regular people are weighing the opportunities and potential harms of large language models and generative AI tools.</p>
<p>“We’re having some sort of moment with technology ethics – AI ethics being just a branch of that,” says Hare. Reflecting on her career, spanning 25 years, she says: “The stuff that we’re talking about today that dominates the headlines – that is dominating the discussion in the tech sector – was not discussed at all at the turn of the century, other than by maybe people in the science and technology studies domain or academics. But it wasn’t filtering into boardrooms. It wasn’t on the front pages of newspapers, and it wasn’t being covered in the national news. So, it’s amazing. A whole field has sprung up.”</p>
<p>However, as Hare makes clear in our interview, we still have a long way to go to build a culture of technology ethics throughout society. Check out the full conversation below or on YouTube.</p>

<p>“The European Union has the AI Act coming down the pike. It doesn’t cover stuff like ChatGPT specifically, but then I don’t know if you want good regulation to cover the technology itself, or how technology is used. I talked about this in my book: do you want to regulate forks – a tool – or do you want to regulate use cases for forks? We’ve regulated the use case, if you will, of murder, or of injury with a fork – or, frankly, any other tool. So it’s the use case we focus on. We don’t really regulate forks. [But] we do regulate some technologies, like biomedical technologies, human genetic stuff, anything nuclear. So we just need to think about where does AI fit with that?” (<a href="https://youtu.be/INKwSTNFSVY?t=342">5:42</a>)</p>
<p>“Move fast and break things was the mantra for this culture [in the technology industry] for a really long time, at least out of the US. And it made a lot of people a lot of money, and they got worshipped by the media. And, you know, they have a whole audience of ‘bros’ who are fans of them. And they’ve never really, any of them, been held to account for what they’ve built.” (<a href="https://youtu.be/INKwSTNFSVY?t=716">11:56</a>)</p>
<p>“Another generation or two, when we’re older, might look at some of what technology we’ve built or our behaviour on climate change, our track record – did we do what we could have done to slow global warming, to improve biodiversity? – and they might hold us to account, saying, ‘You could have stopped this and you didn’t, right? It’s not just what you did. It’s what you did not do.’ So we have to be super careful when we think about ethics, because ethics change, values change over time. And what seems okay today may not be okay in 10, 20, 30 years time. That is on my mind all the time. It’s not very relaxing.” (<a href="https://youtu.be/INKwSTNFSVY?t=1110">18:30</a>)</p>
<p>“[Laws and regulations] are important, they’re necessary, but they’re insufficient. You can act a lot faster if you can get people preventing stuff from being built in the first place, and that means you need to have a culture of people working in technology, both within the organisations – whether that’s research labs, government, companies, universities, whatever – and on the outside – journalists, academics, thinkers, etc., or just the public, an informed public – who can see something and sound the alarm and go, ‘Wait a minute, hang on. That’s not okay.’” (<a href="https://youtu.be/INKwSTNFSVY?t=1982">33:02</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Hello, and welcome to another Real World Data Science interview. I’m Brian Tarran. And today I’m joined by Stephanie Hare, a researcher and broadcaster and author of the book Technology is Not Neutral: A Short Guide to Technology Ethics, which is the focus of our conversation today. Welcome, Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Thank you so much for having me here.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
I feel I’m a bit late to the party with the book. The Financial Times picked it up as one of the best books of summer 2022. But I’ve only just got around to reading it.</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
I mean, I only just got around to reading War and Peace last year. So there’s no rush with these things.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Okay. Well, I mean, I can definitely say it’s one of the best books I’ve read in spring 2023, if that helps, and the only other one I read was Lord of the Rings. So–</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Wow. I mean that’s some pretty august company, you couldn’t thrill me more.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Excellent, excellent. Well, I actually thought coming late to the book might actually have been of benefit to me as a reader because, you know, you’re talking about technology ethics quite broadly. But then you focus in on a couple of use cases, specifically around facial recognition, technology, Covid-19 exposure tracking apps and things like that. But, you know, obviously, since the book was published, the whole discussion around technology ethics has kind of been dominated maybe or taken on a new dimension following the launch and adoption of ChatGPT. I wonder, you know, when the technology was launched, people started using it, adoption rates, you know, went through, went through the roof, what was your kind of initial reaction to all that and what have you made of the kinds of conversations and criticisms that have followed?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare<br>
</strong>Well, I mean, like everybody I was curious and fascinated and wanted to play around with it a bit. I don’t think I’m of the school of thought that seems to be circulating that this will either you know, destroy mankind as we know it or take everybody’s jobs or potentially upend civilization. There’s been some quite extreme, some quite extreme views put across in the media in the past few months since this was widely released to the public. I don’t know, for some reason, I didn’t drink the Kool-Aid, when I started working in technology. So I always take these things with a grain of salt. And I guess my, my cautionary note to anybody listening to this is you know, at this time last year, all of my clients were wanting presentations and analysis about web3 and NFTs and cryptocurrency and before that, it was blockchain. There’s like always a sort of flavour of the month. AI, for people who’ve worked in this field, is known to have winters, summers, springs, autumns, you know, these seasons of when it’s like coming on and really exciting or not? I’m more excited by DeepMind’s use of artificial intelligence, I think they’re actually working on interesting problems, right, around like protein discovery, like real science, as opposed to like, oh, look, I can have a new sci fi avatar or do a deep fake, you know, people can do deep fakes already. We’re just doing them now in even more disturbing ways. So I guess, I guess it’s that. I’m intrigued by it. But I don’t I don’t feel the need to sort of freak out. Either way, positively or negatively, I have a much more sort of detached satellite-level view, I think probably just because I’m older, seeing these trends come and go. And it’s like, let’s just let’s just wait this out and see how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
From your perspective as someone who’s interested in and researching in the area of technology ethics, right, do you see a kind of almost a benefit that the conversation around this has put technology ethics, the conversation around that, on the map? Or do you worry that we’re kind of obsessing over this one technology and this one application? We’re not looking at the field more broadly?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Well, there’s a few things to say on this. So like, first of all, a couple of weeks ago, a bunch of people working in AI, about 1000-plus people – including some fictitious people, by the way – sign this this letter calling for a moratorium on AI research for six months, which was unenforceable, clearly not going to happen, was signed by Elon Musk, who then very quickly announced he was developing his own rival to OpenAI, the company that invented ChatGPT. So you take all of that with a grain of salt. But again, if you’re, if you’re an historian, or if you just have a long memory, you’ll remember that there have been several letters like this. There’s always somebody, you know, very big-wig people. It’s not that we want to dismiss it. But Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk were warning, you know, over around 10 years ago that AI was going to kill humanity if we didn’t put guardrails on it. Professor Stuart Russell talked about this in his Reith Lectures a couple of years ago, which are still online and you can listen to them. And you know, he’s not an alarmist. He’s a serious person and a serious thinker. So we want to listen to him. But I guess what I’m just saying is, you know, every time some sort of new technology or new use case for technology comes up, there’s a group of people who come out and freak out and they get lots of op-eds.&nbsp;It’s usually men, I must say. There’s a lot of women doing some really interesting scholarship in this area that don’t get the op-eds and quite the publicity. So there’s that. Then it is interesting because it makes people think about technology ethics, usually, again, from a place of either fear, right – Are they going to kill us? Are they going to take our jobs? Are they going to remove human agency? – or money – How are people going to make a huge amount of money? Who’s going to make the money? And by displacing whom, right? So, we have two levers: incredible doom or incredible opportunity. And that leaves the rest of us, I think, probably somewhere in the middle, scratching our heads and going like, is this going to actually change my life? And if so, how, and do I really care, given that I’ve got like, you know, a cost of living crisis, recovering from the Covid pandemic for the past few years? Like, if you’re not in this world, it can seem like a lot of shouting. There’s also the question of, do we need new laws? So we know that the European Union has the AI Act coming down the pike. That’s supposed to be passed this year, and there’ll be a two year implementation grace period. So that’s interesting. It doesn’t cover stuff really, like ChatGPT specifically, but then I don’t know if you want good regulation to cover the technology itself, or how technology is used. And I talked about this in my book, like, do you want to regulate forks – a tool – or do you want to regulate use cases for forks? So if I’m, if I stab you, or kill you with a fork, which is totally possible, that is something that we’ve regulated; we’ve regulated the use case, if you will, of murder, or of injury with a fork or frankly, any other tool. So it’s the use case we focus on. We don’t really regulate forks. We do regulate some technologies like bioethics technologies, or biomedical technologies, excuse me, sort of human genetic stuff, anything nuclear. Those technologies we do specifically regulate. So we just need to think about where does AI fit with that? And also, do we need new regulations for everything, or can we use existing ones? And that’s what’s becoming really interesting is that in the US, where I’m from, the main regulator, the FTC, seems to think that it can use a lot of existing laws already. So they’ve been like, if your AI is claiming to do stuff that it can’t, we’re gonna come after you under, like, kind of sort of false advertising, if you will, misrepresenting yourself. They might come after some of the big AI companies based on anti-competition law, right? So no new laws needed for that. And then with the music industry, they’ve been going after all the people who are like, oh, let’s like remix a Drake song, and saying, well, actually, you can’t do that, because you’re violating copyright law, take it down. Right. So again, I don’t want to be like too, too calm about it. Like, we do need to look at some of the use cases that are really problematic and hurting people. But we might actually have a lot more in our arsenal to combat this than we’re currently using. And I think what’s going to happen is, unfortunately, the pace of crafting legislation, and then regulators never fully enforce regulations– Look at the GDPR: no company’s ever been given the full fine. And here in the UK, the ICO is famous for letting companies off the hook, giving them less than half of the original fine. It’s ridiculous. So if you’re going to pin your hopes on regulation, I’m not sure that’s great. I’m weirdly more optimistic about landmark legal cases. So we’re seeing an Australian mayor who was totally defamed by ChatGPT, in Australia, he’s going to be taking or is taking OpenAI to court. And then we might see some of these copyright issues, that could be taken to court, right. And like, that’s where people I think will get more action and, frankly, more respect, because these companies are really happy to pay a lot of money to lobby our lawmakers, and water stuff down. And they always say, Oh, my God, it’s going to constrain innovation. And if they really get desperate, they’ll be like, China! If we don’t, if we’re not allowed to do everything we want, China will win! That is like a– that is just a game that takes everybody nowhere, whereas in the lawsuit angle, that’s interesting, because you’re demonstrating responsibility, you’re discussing liability, you’re having to demonstrate harm. And in the process of discovery, right, you might be able to actually get some of these companies to open up their datasets, how their algorithms work, like, I’m much more intrigued to see where that’s gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah, but I think I mean, having read your book, I would, I would have thought you might perceive all of this sort of stuff as kind of sticking plasters to put over the the injuries that might be caused by these technologies, right? Your argument seems to be that we have an issue whereby we don’t have a culture of technology ethics. So when we’re thinking about building these tools, or when we’re starting off down the path of creating something like this, we’re not already thinking about, you know, the use cases, the harms that might arise from that and things like that. What does it take to build a culture of technology ethics, do you think, in our society, in our academic institutions in our companies?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Honestly, I think, I think this whole accountability piece is going to be what it takes. Because you see, like Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai gave an interview recently to CBS 60 Minutes in the US where he was like, yeah, there’s a risk that this technology could get out of control, like dot dot dot, this would be terrible for mankind. And you see him kind of be like, hope somebody does something about that. And it’s like, I know somebody that might do something about that, Mr Pichai – you! But clearly he feels, and you can see his point, he feels that right now, if it’s not illegal, then it’s permissible. And he has to win market share. If he doesn’t do it, he’s going to lose. And companies have this all the time. If they wait too long, they lose their first-mover advantage, and they get destroyed. We can go through like countless examples of that in business, particularly in technology. So I get it. But what he isn’t understanding is that if his company is the one that puts out the technology that leads to terrible harm – you know, physically killing people, harming them, destroying the national security infrastructure, something like that – right now, I don’t think he’s thinking about how that’s going to affect him. And that’s because we don’t really penalise executives very often. The worst that might happen is they might leave with a huge golden parachute, and go off and sort of retire in Hawaii with their millions, right? Like nothing really happens to them. So how do you have a culture of technology ethics, where the people who are creating technology and have the power to stop, right, to maybe like back off on stuff, they aren’t really thinking about how will I personally be held responsible if this goes south? So like, Sam Altman and OpenAI, same thing, he was like, he gave an interview where he’s like, I’m really scared about this technology I’m building. It’s like, okay, you could slow down or back off, you could make your datasets open, you could make your algorithms open. You’re called Open AI, that was supposed to be your whole mission, why you were created was to benefit humanity, like, what are you doing? So it’s weird. And I think it comes from the fact that, you know, move fast and break things was the mantra for this culture for a really long time, at least out of the US. And it made a lot of people a lot of money, and they got worshipped by the media. And you know, they have a whole audience of bros who are fans of them. And they’ve never really, any of them, been held to account for what they’ve built.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So your interest in technology ethics clearly predates you know, that all the noise at the moment around large language models and generative AI and things like that. What was it that got you interested in this subject? Was it a particular application, something that caused some concern? Or– How did it come about?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
This is gonna sound completely weird, but it didn’t come from my experience in tech, really, at all. I have had two paths in my adult life, one has been working in these technology companies with a brief but happy foray in political risk, which is now sort of part of the skill set for tech. But I trained as an historian, and I interviewed someone who was a French civil servant, who at the end of his life was put on trial for crimes against humanity for his actions as a young civil servant during the Second World War. So he collaborated, as so many French civil servants did. And in the course of that collaboration, over a period of many years, went from just, you know, just signing documents and kind of doing what he was told to do, to deporting people and sending them to Auschwitz. So I was very young when I interviewed him, and that marked me, as I would hope it would mark anybody. I talked with him on and off for about three years, until he died. And that was the subject of my PhD. And then I did a fellowship at St.&nbsp;Anthony’s College, Oxford, and spent years looking at it further. And that’s actually going to be my next book. I needed a long time to sit with that material and to read around it, but I had to get the interview while he was still alive. He was so old, he was 93 when I started talking to him, and so it was important to get that down for posterity’s sake first, and then circle back and do some analysis later when I was a bit older. When you talk to somebody who in his case was, you know, not antisemitic, not of the far right politically, was actually like centre-left, had lots of Jewish friends, etc. Was like top of his class, you know, came from a milieu and a background and a formation that I think many of us would read and be like, Okay, that seems pretty reasonable. You ask yourself, how on earth did that person in his, like, young period of his late 20s, early 30s end up being involved and actively participating in what ends up being mass murder. It’s probably the most extreme case study of ethics, or one of the most extreme case studies of ethics that I could have stumbled upon. And it stayed with me and to be honest, it shapes a lot of my work and how I think about human rights and civil liberties and the freedoms that we so often take for granted because I’ve studied, as an historian looking at France and Germany, how quickly those things can be taken away – very quickly, terrifyingly so, in fact. So that lens is always with me. And when I was then working in technology, and seeing some of the things that could be done with these tools and watching this lack of accountability, down to the point of gross negligence in some cases. And also, as a young technologist, not being given any training – we were given no training at all in ethics, in, like, discussing data protection – it was basically: this is the law, just obey the law, like, that’s the, that’s the box that you have to play in. Other than that, like, go for it. And when I look back on that now it’s like, Oh, my God, that’s the equivalent of putting your family in the car, and everybody goes off without wearing their seatbelts on and, you know, all this sort of safety design that we take for granted in cars now, it’s just mad when you think about it, or the way we used to fly. We’re in this phase, it’s really interesting, just over the course of my career – 25 years – where the stuff that we’re talking about today that dominates the headlines, right, that is dominating the discussion in the tech sector, was not discussed at all at the turn of the century, other than by maybe people in the science and technology studies domain or academics. But it wasn’t filtering into boardrooms. It wasn’t on the front pages of newspapers, and it wasn’t being covered in the national news, whereas like now that is all I’m doing. So it’s amazing. A whole field has sprung up.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
I think that that kind of origin story, if you like, explains some of your, perhaps, belief in the importance of exploring this accountability question when it comes to technology, ethics?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Yeah, because I watched it, and I think what was so fascinating– So as I say, I was in my early 20s. In fact, I was 20, when this man was put on trial, and I had just moved to France. It was the longest trial in French legal history – it was a big deal, you could not not watch it. So I was reading this and seeing it in the press every day, and I watched the French people discussing it around me, you know, really being divisive, this stuff does not go away. And his view was: I was just following orders, I was doing what I was told to do. Which you know, you hear that a lot from engineers or people who are like, this is the design spec I’ve been given, or this is what my boss has told me to do, or this is what our investors want, etc. Or people feel they don’t have the power to stand up because, you know what, they’ve got a mortgage, they’ve got kids, and employers know that, like, they know that and they use it as leverage against people to silence them. Or they’ve signed an NDA, because we get made to sign these NDAs when we work in tech, and then we get made to sign another NDA when we leave, right, so we can’t disparage our employer, and maybe we’re given some money so we don’t talk about the things we’ve seen. You know, it’s, it’s gross – it’s a gross little world, and like you have to be very, very solid and take good care of yourself to work in it, I reckon. To try and keep your ethical and moral compass. It’s hard. So I think because I saw that. And I saw that someone who – whether we believe him or not, this is what he claimed – in his 30s, he was just doing kind of what everybody around him was doing under a situation of crisis. He was let off the hook. I mean, he wasn’t just not persecuted in 1945, he was actually promoted. And then he became France’s top civil servant, and then he became an MP, and then he became budget minister. I mean, this guy’s career was not hurt in any way by what he did. On the contrary, right, he advanced. And yet, by the end of his life, French values had changed, so a new generation wanted to hold him to account. And I think about that a lot for all of us, right, who are sort of walking around in our 30s or 40s. Another generation or two, when we’re older, might look at some of what technology we’ve built or our behaviour on climate change, our track record – did we do what we could have done to slow global warming, to improve biodiversity? – and they might, they might hold us to account saying, you could have stopped this and you didn’t, right? It’s not just what you did. It’s what you did not do. Right. So we have to be super careful when we think about ethics, because ethics change, values change over time. And what seems okay today may not be okay in 10, 20, 30 years time, and we might be the 80- or 90-year-olds who are put on trial. That is on my mind all the time, right. It’s not very relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
No, and I guess it makes me think. Well, I mean, this is getting into the hypotheticals right. But is it– if we can’t necessarily predict or plan out how values might evolve over time, is it enough to be able to, to just say or to document that we asked the right questions at the time, rather than just doing things blindly. Is that where we need to kind of almost formalise our process of writing down, setting out, you know, we want to do this, we’ve considered these potential harms, we’ve considered these potential benefits, and we kind of document that so at least, you know, future generations can say well, “They thought about it. They might have not thought about it in the right way, but they tried”?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Absolutely, I think, you know, show your work and be like, these were our, you know, these were our sort of first principles of where we were starting from, this is the context in which we were making this decision. Because again, I don’t, I don’t necessarily fear the judgement of history in terms of if I get something wrong. People get stuff wrong all the time. That’s just being human. It’s, did I not care? You know, was I like, well, sorry, little little boys and girls who are babies now, like, I need to do my stuff, and like, I don’t care about you, right? That attitude is tough. Or I decided I just really, you know, I really needed to buy a flat. So I decided to work for some dodgy company, or dodgy, dodgy company that’s owned by a foreign government, but I knew it was going to be fine, and they’re offering me a tonne of money, and now I can go on nicer holidays. I’ve had these conversations with people about this literally this past week, like, these are live issues for people. There’s a cost of living crisis, ethics can feel like a luxury for some people rather than a necessity. And human beings are very bad, all of us, at thinking about, you know, future selves, right? Like we kind of, we optimise for how we’re feeling now, and we’ll deal with 20 years from now later if we even get there. So I think there’s that. There’s also– this really inspired the writing of the book, Technology is Not Neutral. I knew, I had this weird sense – I had just gone independent, so I had left working for these companies, I was not under any NDAs anymore, which right there gives you a clue; I could say what I wanted – but I also knew there was a chance that I was going to have to go back either into industry, or maybe work for a government, I don’t know what I’m going to need to do in the future or who I’m going to want to work with or what reasons I might even have for that. But I knew I had this window of being an independent researcher and broadcaster, that I could say whatever I wanted, and I had that thing of like, okay, if you’ve had a window of, say, five years, for example, what would you say if you were not afraid? If you were not scared? If you were like, you know, screw the money, screw the corporate pressure, screw the government, whatever, what do you want to talk to the public about? And my views were, I really wanted to talk to them about facial recognition, because I feel people just fundamentally do not understand how dangerous that technology is and how it can be used. I wanted to talk about the pandemic technologies, because we were, you know, I was writing it during the pandemic, and I thought, well, if a pandemic ever happens again, let’s have a nice little tidy case study for potentially future historians or future medical personnel, public health officials to pull out, because when the pandemic hit, we all had to go back and look at stuff from the Spanish flu. You know, there’s a lot of discussion of like, why has this come as such a surprise? Are we going to use these technologies again or not? Right. Like, you know, is it worth it? Is the return on investment worth it in all senses – ethically, as well as medically, all of those things? So I thought I would lay down a couple of markers that I hoped would stand the test of time. But the big thing I wanted to do, because I was always thinking I might have to go and sign another NDA and go work because I too must earn my living, was I wanted to write something so that anyone who cares about technology, is working in it, is investing in it, right – it’s not just people who code, it’s people who fund the people who code. Buying technology – procurement is massive, you’re a really powerful person if you’re in charge of procurement. But also just consumers, and citizens and parents, and teachers and kids. If I could write up everything that I had learned in my 25 years, and succinctly as possible, right – as short as possible, because people are tired, they’re busy – I could pass that baton on, so that if I ever have to stop going on television and radio, and I’m no longer allowed to write in newspapers and warn people about the stuff I’m seeing and the abuses of power, and showing them examples of history of how this can go so terribly wrong, maybe it will have, like, lit somebody else. And I’m delighted to report – I mean, we’ll see; time will tell, it’s only been out a year – the amount of people who have brought me in to train their staff, to talk to their board. I’ve talked to children. I’ve talked to university students, I’ve taught classes all over the world, because we can now do online teaching. I’ve taken a lot of it on television and radio and in the newspapers. People wanted this, and I’m not the only person working on it, of course – there’s been a whole flowering of people, scholars, etc., working in putting out amazing books and documentaries. It’s really, we’re having some sort of moment with technology ethics – AI ethics being just a branch of that. So that’s really encouraging. So I sort of feel like, you know, again, if I, if I’m gonna have to account for myself at the age of 93, I would like to be able to point to that and go, I tried. I tried. And I have no idea if it will succeed or not, but I stood up to the plate and I swung the bat and, you know, I aimed for the bleachers.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
One of the things I thought was really interesting about the book, it comes towards the end when you’re kind of talking about, you’re summing up, and you talk about how your thinking about almost like the the approach or solution to the technology ethics issue has changed over the course of the writing of the book. You had, like, a list of potential, like, proposals, proposed actions that you wanted to analyse, but then you realised that actually technology ethics is a “wicked problem”. I wonder if you could explain what that term means for people who might not be familiar with it and and why you think of it that way?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Yeah, I’m so grateful to have learned about the term “wicked problem”. My friend Jason Crabtree, who wrote an amazing book about electricity grids, like smart electricity grids, for Cambridge University Press, had asked me to read his manuscript maybe 10 years ago, and I read it, and one thing I took away that just absolutely blew my mind was this concept. So I shall gift it to you for those of you have not heard it. Because then suddenly, you’re like, God, it makes so much sense. There are certain problems, I would say, like, the climate crisis, and biodiversity loss would be a good example of this. There’s certain problems that have many causes, many causes, so there isn’t going to be one solution to fix them. So people constantly ask me, oh, is this the magic bullet? No, they’re like, there are certain problems that there is no magic bullet – the pandemic is probably another, actually. Then, if you do try to solve these wicked problems, the mere act of solving them can introduce a whole new set of problems to them. So like, it becomes even more of a head– You know, I’m trying not to swear, but a messing with your head moment. And it’s exhausting, you know, and it gives you your forehead wrinkles and makes you just sort of want to bang your forehead onto the nearest wall. And yet, you also can’t opt out and be like, well, it’s just too hard. It’s a wicked problem. There’s no solution, there’s nothing to be done, you know, throw up your hands, because you’re like, Yeah, but the problem is, is if we don’t do anything, like literally people are dying; literally, climates are becoming uninhabitable, we’re going to have massive climate migration, that’s going to cause all sorts of problems, water scarcity, we can have wars over this, like, we have to do something. So like, you have to still act on a wicked problem, all while knowing that it’s not going to be solved in a binary sense of like zero, one, black and white, I can point to it and measure it. And for people who like metrics, that’s a real pain, because they’re like, I want to know what good looks like and I want to know how we’ll know when we get there, you know, what’s the percentage, what’s the number? And you kind of have to be like, Well, with a wicked problem, you might never solve it, or you won’t solve it once. Because again, with something like climate change, or pandemics, these are things you’re probably gonna have to solve again, and again, and again, because it’s dynamic. And it’s constant, you know, we’re always going to be managing our relationship with the climate, with the environment. So, you know, we can pick a certain temperature, or a certain percentage of landmass that, you know, has trees or whatever, and like, come up with a little metric for our metric-oriented friends. But that’s still not very meaningful. So it’s more that when you think of a wicked problem, like facial recognition technologies, like, we need to be able to identify people in certain situations, and like, we want that, right. Like, we want to be able to catch criminals, and we want to be able to catch terrorists when they’ve managed to pull off a terrible act of, of harm to people. But at the same time, do you want to turn your society into a sort of permanent dragnet? Do we not care about privacy? If so, like, when do we care about privacy? And when are we okay with maybe sacrificing that for the greater good and who decides that? It’s really problematic if you live in London as I do, and your police force, which is using this technology, has admitted, they’ve admitted themselves to being misogynist, institutionally misogynist, homophobic, racist, right? And then we’re gonna give them a technology that doesn’t work very well on people with certain skin. It doesn’t identify people of a certain age as well. It’s got all sorts of problems. So you’re kind of like, hmm? Facial recognition is covered a bit under the EU AI Act. But even then there’s like so many loopholes. And the thing is, if you cite national security, it usually gets waved through because no one wants to be the person who said, I said we couldn’t use this technology, and then something bad happened. Right? So you err on the side of, like, the precautionary principle. The default is, let them use it. We must trust them. Except what do you do if your police force has given you quite ample evidence not to trust them? Or companies. You know, this is not to bash on the police, by the way – companies are some of the worst offenders in this area. So that’s what I mean about it being a wicked problem is, it’s out there. It’s installed. It’s all over the UK, it’s definitely all over the US as well. And we don’t really have a good framework for it.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
But then this is where we loop back around to the kind of culture, right, creating a culture of technology ethics? You know, we can’t just put a checklist in place once, do it, tick it off, yeah, we’ve done that for facial recognition technology, we’re good to go. Because there are always new potential use cases for it, new applications, new integrations with different systems that we always need to be thinking, every time, is this the right thing to do? Or–</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
I mean, I’m still a big fan of checklists. So it’s not that I’m anti-checklist. And I’m not saying that you said that, by the way, I’m more thinking aloud. Checklists can still be useful, right? Like, whenever I’m in a really bad mood, I’m like, Okay, hang on, have I slept? Do I just need a glass of water? Am I hungry? You know, what I think is angry may just be that I skipped lunch. You can kind of go through those things, and anybody who’s had to like troubleshoot why a baby or a small child is unhappy will also have a checklist and what’s on the thing – ah, they missed naptime, where’s their bear? That sort of thing. Companies need checklists, because you’re trying to get loads of people singing from the same hymn sheet, I get that. But what I wanted to get away from was this idea that, like, one person or one team gets this checklist and maybe does that once a year, once a quarter, pick your cadence – and everybody else gets a pass. Ethics doesn’t work that way, because again, ethics is kind of I think in the wicked problem scenario of, like, how do we decide what our values are and how to live them? And how do we know, where do we draw the line? And then how do you, how do you decide if you’ve gone over the line or not? And all of that, who decides who decides? Those are really complex questions that mean that really you can’t abdicate. This is, in a company’s case, it’s the CEO, it’s the board, all the way on down – it has to be baked in to every single employee, and also investors, mindset. And I was thinking about it in terms of cybersecurity, I once had a colleague who gave me an analogy that I think is helpful, so I’ll share it for what it’s worth: When you go on to, say, an oil rig, in the North Sea – a highly dangerous environment – you might be the most junior person there, and you’re there for your very first day of work. But if you spot something on that rig that is a health and safety risk, you have to speak up. You’re not going to go, like, Oh, my boss might say something, whatever, because, like, everybody’s life on that rig is depending on everyone having that culture of careful, that’s not okay. And that really put me in mind where it was like, Oh, wow, we’re going to have to like inculcate an entire new mindset. And we think about technology ethics a lot because of technology being the word, and we think it must mean like hardware or software, it’s always about coding, and it’s often guys in hoodies coding. But my preferred method of hacking is culture. Right. So like, again, if we tried to just solve everything through regulation and laws, that takes, you know – if you look at the average time it takes to pass a law and then for regulators to enforce it – ages, we’re talking years, like it’s too late. These technologies will have moved on. Ditto, calls for international treaties. Do it, by all means. Have a look at how long it takes most international treaties to get passed and then ratified – and then, P.S. What happens when people break them? Really, right. So like, they’re important, they’re necessary, but they’re insufficient. You can act a lot faster if you can get people preventing stuff from being built in the first place, and that means you need to have a culture of people working in technology, both within the organisations – whether that’s research labs, government, companies, universities, whatever – and on the outside – journalists, academics, thinkers, etc, just the public, an informed public – who can see something and do what I just described on the oil rig, like, sound the alarm and go, Wait a minute, hang on. That’s not okay. That is, that to me feels faster. And I’m way more into prevention than cure, for all sorts of reasons. So I think like, yes, to laws and regulations, yes, to treaties; this will be faster. And I think it will be more resilient.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah, I agree. And I have to say, wrapping up, that I think Technology is Not Neutral is a great place to start to inculcate that mind shift, that mindset change. So, Stephanie, thank you very much for joining us today.</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
You said you’re working on a new book. Have you got a timeline for that? Or a title?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
No.&nbsp;I am the slowest thinker and writer, I’m like the opposite of move fast and break things, I’m like move slowly and like think it over maybe several times. So I’m just getting started out. I’ll sort of go five years. It’s gonna be, it’s a history book. Alright. So this is, this is different, I’m having to take my classes in French and German right now to get kind of match fit in those languages again, and then you know, I’ll be off and writing. But, yeah, I hope to have another book out, you know, in five years.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Well, if the year it took me to read Technology is Not Neutral is any indication, in three, four or five years time it will still be relevant today. So–</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Hare</strong><br>
That’s the thing with history, it always stands the test of time.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Well, thank you, thank you again for joining us on Real World Data Science. It’s been a pleasure talking to you.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Hi, Sami. Thank you for sharing your career story with Real World Data Science. Please tell us a little about yourself and your role in data science.</strong><br>
Hello! I’m Sami Rahman, a passionate head of data engineering and data platform at Penguin Random House, the book publisher that has enriched lives through literature. I started my career in data science five years ago and I’ve evolved into a data generalist with expertise in machine learning, data infrastructure, and data strategy.</p>
<p><strong>What does your job involve?</strong><br>
My role is about harnessing the power of data to drive extraordinary outcomes. Leading a skilled team, we empower our company to leverage data and cutting-edge technologies for informed decisions and automation. I help shape our organisation’s capabilities in data science, analytics, machine learning, data management, and strategy.</p>
<p><strong>What does “data science” mean to you?</strong><br>
Data science, to me, is a captivating fusion of modern data technologies and computational statistics that tackles business challenges, crafts intelligent automation, and generates insightful revelations.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist?</strong><br>
Active listening is key. A data scientist must be surgical and precise in developing models, analysis, and tools that reinforce the company’s bottom line and operations. Data science exists to create value using data.</p>

<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/images/pullquote-purple.png" class="img-fluid" width="50"></p>
<p>As I’ve transitioned into management, maintaining my coding prowess is an ongoing challenge. I stay sharp by doing data science and infrastructure development for fun, leveraging tools like ChatGPT and AirOps where I’m rusty.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>How did you get into data science?</strong><br>
I began with a psychology degree, which led to working as business psychologist where I discovered psychometric data analysis. After a master’s in countering organised crime and terrorism and a few short jobs in counter terrorism/intelligence, I decided that it wasn’t for me. I embraced my love for statistics and research, I dove into data science, learning Python through online platforms, and secured my first data scientist role at a WPP agency called Essence.</p>
<p><strong>What, or who, first inspired you to become a data scientist?</strong><br>
I always thought someone like me couldn’t work in data, let alone data science. <a href="https://www.wbs.ac.uk/about/person/suzy-moat/">Dr Suzy Moat’s</a> fascinating talk on machine learning’s application to human behaviour and psychology showed me that a psychologist could make a significant impact in this field, inspiring my aspiration to try to have a data science career.</p>
<p><strong>What were the hurdles or challenges that you needed to overcome on your route into the profession?</strong><br>
Breaking into data science without a typical background in maths/computer science/physics was daunting. Building a Kaggle portfolio and coding models for fun prepared me for interviews. Another challenge was learning to harmonise my “data brain” and “business brain” to solve problems efficiently. Understanding how data solutions impact business problems will always propel you forward. </p>
<p><strong>And what are the challenges that you face now, as a working data scientist?</strong><br>
As I’ve transitioned into management, maintaining my coding prowess is an ongoing challenge. I stay sharp by doing data science and infrastructure development for fun, leveraging tools like ChatGPT and AirOps where I’m rusty. I’m currently building my own cloud data platform and running a lot of image neural networks on it.</p>
<p><strong>What was your first job in data science, and how does it compare to your current role?</strong><br>
As an analytics executive at WPP agency Essence, I tackled data science, cloud engineering, and analytics problems for clients. They were a lot more singular and tactical in nature. Now, as head of data engineering and data platform at Penguin Random House, I focus on shaping data and technology strategy to align with the company’s broader vision.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most important thing you learned in your first year on the job?</strong><br>
To always consider the bigger picture: how your work integrates with the organisation/client’s objectives, delivers value, and aligns with the aspirations of other stakeholders. Actionable insights and value is the most important thing.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your career highlights so far?</strong><br>
Two shining moments include being the first of three of HSBC UK fraud data science leaders, where each of our departments tackled a different type of crime and protected our customers, and developing data strategies and capabilities for analytics, science, and business intelligence at Penguin Random House.</p>
<p><strong>Have there been any mistakes or regrets along the way?</strong><br>
I regret not delving deeper into natural language processing (NLP) or spatial data science, which are now more accessible and growing fields within data science. I reckon the NLP methodologies would’ve been extremely useful seeing as I’m at a publishing company now!</p>
<p><strong>How do you think your role will evolve over the rest of your career?</strong><br>
As data technologies become more accessible, I anticipate data roles will transform. I envision a future where data professionals focus on general AI, quantum machine learning, and multi-dimensional data analytics as traditional specialisms become democratised.</p>
<p><strong>If you were starting out in data science now, what three things would you put at the top of your reading/study list?</strong><br>
I’d recommend <em>Skin in the Game</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <em>Calling Bullshit: The Art of Scepticism in a Data-Driven World</em> by Jevin West and Carl Bergstrom,  and <em>Artificial Intelligence: How Machine Learning Will Shape the Next Decade</em> by Matthew Burgess.</p>
<p><strong>What personal or professional advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist now?</strong><br>
Success in data science hinges on understanding how it can transform organisations and engaging with business stakeholders. My advice: never stop listening to the business – the stakeholders are your biggest allies. I would also try to find your niche that sets you apart from everyone else. Mine when I first started in the field was my expertise on computational psychology and behavioural machine learning. </p>
<p><strong>What new ideas or developments in the field of data science are you personally most excited about or intrigued by?</strong><br>
Transfer learning excites me most, as numerous large technology companies now offer pre-trained models based on billions/trillions of parameters. This will revolutionise industries worldwide, as it will be easier to build more performant models even if a company has less data.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the main challenges facing data science as a field in the next few years?</strong><br>
The challenge lies in staying relevant amidst the democratisation of data science. Through large language models, low-code, and transfer learning, advanced data science methods will become easier for non-specialists to do and use. Innovation and keeping up with modern data technologies will be crucial.</p>

  <title>The politics of performance measurement</title>
  <dc:creator>Noah Wright</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/04/18/politics-of-performance-measurement.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>At the beginning of 2016, the Criminal Justice Division (CJD) of the Texas Governor’s Office received news all government agencies dread: budgets were to be cut. CJD oversaw a grant program that funded specialty courts throughout the state, however it was now being told that the program’s budget of $10.6m would be reduced 20% to $8.5m by 2018.</p>
<p>How should these cuts be distributed among grant holders? CJD had no meaningful performance data on which to base its decisions, and I would know: I was hired by the agency just a few months before to analyze grant performance. Still, decisions needed to be made. We had to come up with a plan of action, and the clock was ticking…</p>
<p>This is a story of making opportunity out of crisis, of the interaction between not just theory of change and technical implementation, but the “political” process of negotiating these changes with stakeholders in a manner that led to better decisions. Through careful outreach and continuous communication, we developed a data collection and performance assessment process that enabled us to allocate budget cuts in a manner widely accepted.</p>
<p>The story ends on a bittersweet note. But, along the way, there are lessons to be learned about how to find common ground, manage expectations, forge productive working partnerships, and sustain a data science project longer term.</p>

<section id="step-1-consider-your-options" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-consider-your-options">Step 1: Consider your options</h2>
<p>Texas had over 150 specialty courts in 2016, providing a program of specialized services – usually drug treatment – to offenders as an alternative to incarceration. About half of the state’s specialty courts received CJD grant funds (and about half of grantees received 100% of their program budget from our grants). Funding cuts of the size we needed to make would not go over well with them. Any changes to the program would have to run a gauntlet of decision-makers including advisory boards, interest groups, and professional associations, most with contacts in the legislature.</p>
<p>Complicating this situation further, CJD didn’t even make the final funding decisions. We administered the grants, but the merit review process fell to the Specialty Courts Advisory Council, an appointed group of specialty courts staff and related experts who annually scored the grant applications we received. We needed to get them onboard.</p>
<p>The way our Executive Director saw it, we had three options to implement the cut in a way that could get us buy-in from stakeholders and the Advisory Council:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Cut across the board.</strong> The Advisory Council would employ the same scoring method as the previous year but reduce each grant amount by 20%.</li>
</ol>
<p>This option would leave long-running grantees scrambling to make up for this shortfall by reducing services, laying off staff, or spending more of their limited local funds. Worse, it would punish all grantees equally – our most successful programs would be arbitrarily defunded.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Fewer grants.</strong> Grants were scored based on the quality of their application and all grants that passed a certain threshold got funded. The Advisory Council would employ the same scoring method as the previous year but instead of funding the top $10.6m worth of grants, they would fund the top $8.5m worth.</li>
</ol>
<p>This seemed a less bad option than cutting across the board, but we would still run into the problem of arbitrarily defunding successful programs. Grants near the bottom of the Advisory Council’s cutoff that got funded the previous year would be denied renewal only because the goalposts had moved.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Targeted funding.</strong> The Advisory Council would incorporate performance data and statewide strategic plan alignment into their scoring method and make cuts accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time, the Advisory Council did not take performance into consideration when scoring grant applications. They agreed in theory that a grant requesting its tenth annual renewal should perhaps at some point be assessed on its outcomes, but they had never seen CJD commit to a rigorous performance assessment process before. We administered the grants, not them, so without our commitment to develop a performance assessment process, and their trust in that commitment, this would not be a viable option.</p>
<p>After due consideration, option 3 emerged as the favorite of our Executive Director. On the face of it, this seemed the most “objective” approach to take. We would let the data decide who gets funded and who doesn’t, rather than cutting arbitrarily. But that would be a fallacious argument. Data does not decide. It might inform our decisions, but it would be up to us to choose the structure of the performance measurement process: what aspects to focus on, what data to collect, what benchmarks to set – all of which would later help determine funding decisions. And in any funding decision, politics inevitably plays a role.</p>
<p>Politics is, in its broadest sense, the negotiated decision-making between groups with opposing interests. And in developing our performance measurement process we would encounter a variety of interests – from the Advisory Council down to the grantees themselves. Success would require us to acknowledge stakeholder perspectives and address or manage them appropriately. Planning decisions made in the early phases of a project as a result of political processes directly influence the type and scope of analysis a data scientist will eventually be able to perform, so it behooves the data scientist to participate in these processes!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-engage-stakeholders-and-define-performance">Step 2: Engage stakeholders and define performance</h2>
<p>Having settled on our preferred option, our Executive Director convened a strategy session with the Advisory Council to discuss how to proceed as part of a broader strategic plan. The session began by achieving consensus on high-level goals such as “fund strategically”, “focus on success”, “build capacity”, etc. The session also helped the Advisory Council and CJD alike to clarify our conception of how we ought to fit into the specialty courts field going forward. CJD would develop its performance assessment system to help the Advisory Council target funding, but that would come as part of a larger plan that included capacity building, training and technical assistance, helping courts obtain non-CJD sources of funding, and steering grantees toward established best practice.</p>
<p>We left the meeting with a very basic plan that looked good on paper. Our Executive Director set to work persuading our external stakeholders of the wisdom of this new strategic direction. Meanwhile, I had to build a performance assessment process that people could trust.</p>
<p>CJD had no formally designated standards to measure performance data against. However, drug courts have been around for decades and there existed a large body of research supporting the program model.<sup>1</sup> Offering supervised drug treatment instead of incarceration had been repeatedly shown to cost less money and lower recidivism rates. I performed a literature review and spoke with numerous subject matter experts to get started on defining program-specific performance metrics.</p>
<p>I was conscious that imposing metrics without any feedback or input from affected parties would all but guarantee bad-faith engagement, especially if these metrics are tied to funding. A problem inherent to any performance measurement is that once something gets measured as a performance outcome, it warps the very processes it is intended to measure. This phenomenon happens so frequently that the phrase “Campbell’s Law” was coined to describe it in 1979.<sup>2</sup> Think of standardized testing at schools: once the government ties test performance to school funding it creates powerful incentives for schools to improve test scores at any cost. Even in the absence of outright cheating, struggling schools feel massive pressure to adjust their curriculum, to the point where they teach test score optimization strategies more than math, language, history, and science.</p>
<p>I consistently heard from specialty court scholars and practitioners alike that arrest recidivism would be the ideal outcome measure. On paper, recidivism was a direct expression of long-term program success and could also be used as an outcome variable for classification modeling. And, in practice, a court could do little to affect recidivism by way of manipulation. Courts do not make arrests – police make arrests. Once a specialty court participant finished a program, the court itself no longer intervened in their lives. If a participant got arrested within 1-3 years of completion, the program had no say in the matter.</p>
<p>This, however, presented an implementation problem: one-year recidivism data would, by definition, take a year past the point of implementation to collect, i.e., not soon enough to inform our cuts. And while recidivism was the best measure of success, it could not be the only measure. Recidivism was, after all, a stochastic process not within the court’s control – a crime wave or other systemic factors could move recidivism up and make it look like a successful court had actually failed. We would have to use something else as well.</p>
<p>The National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) publishes a book of best practice standards, and our stakeholders identified a court’s adherence to these standards as another strong performance assessment standard. These criteria, unlike recidivism, were directly under the program’s control. Does your program have the recommended staff? Does your program drug test participants frequently enough to guarantee sobriety? Does your program meet with participants regularly enough? Do you offer a continuum of services instead of a “one-size-fits-all” approach?</p>
<p>In addition to being much easier to measure than recidivism, best practice adherence also resists Campbell’s Law by avoiding outcome measurement. In our school metaphor, this would be like measuring school performance based on student-to-teacher ratio, variety of course offerings, attendance rates, and teacher qualifications. Far from perfect, but measuring a variety of elements that predict success and taking them as a whole represents a vast improvement over a single, easily-gamed outcome measure.</p>
<p>But to operationalize these standards, we would have to have good data.</p>

<section id="step-3-update-processes-and-collect-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-update-processes-and-collect-data">Step 3: Update processes and collect data</h2>
<p>We inherited a longstanding process in which grantees had to fill out a form every six months asking them to report performance data. This is a screenshot of what that form looked like:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/04/18/images/screenshot.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="A screenshot of a data table containing example data collected from grantees in the Texas speciality courts funding program, prior to the development of a new performance measurement process."></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>No additional definitions or instructions were provided, leaving grantees with many questions: Does the request for “annual data” mean as of fiscal year or calendar year? What counts as a person being “assessed for eligibility”? And so on. Grantees did not know the answers, and neither did we. And these were the more straightforward measures. The form went on for 10 pages, most of which asked grantees to report extensively on information they had already provided as part their application.</p>
<p>This disaster of an assessment process did have a silver lining. When we announced we were throwing out these forms entirely we faced almost no pushback from grantees.</p>
<p>We knew from the start that our new assessment process would need to collect individual-level participant data instead of aggregated measures. Even with clear definitions, 75 grants would mean 75 different aggregations at work. Asking the grantees to report their individual-level participant data in a consistent format and doing the aggregations ourselves meant a single aggregation at work.</p>
<p>But we needed to establish trust with grantees before making this request. Strictly speaking, we could mandate the reporting of this data. However, if that angered enough of our grantees, they or their contacts might take it up with our bosses at the Governor’s Office, and our bosses could cancel any plan we came up with if they thought it was not worth the fuss. So, from day one we communicated clearly to all grantees that we would maintain total transparency when it came to definitions and calculations. Before we used any calculated metric to assess performance we would send it to the grantees themselves to review for accuracy.</p>
<p>To avoid the vagueness and inscrutability that characterized the old reporting process, every piece of data we asked for in the new process had a clear written definition and specific reason for being asked. These reasons usually amounted to some combination of best practices, Advisory Council recommendations, and grantee suggestions.</p>
<p>Implementing the new process was far from easy, however. We faced numerous administrative and technical barriers. Texas courts at this time did not share a common case management system, so we couldn’t just get a data export from everybody. Meanwhile, the Governor’s Office banned all of its divisions from all usage of the cloud. This forced us to build a more labor-intensive reporting process, in which courts would obtain blank Excel templates with required data fields. Courts had either to fill out these templates by hand or export their case management data and reconfigure it to template specifications. Then, courts submitted their data for review and we sent back any bad formatting.</p>
<p>We collected preliminary data at the six-month mark and made another adjustment based on these results, which we would not count toward performance measurement. A majority of courts had some kind of data error in this first case. Specific definitions of data fields had to be written and rewritten using grantee feedback over the course of the year, leading to significant changes between the six-month reports and the year-end reports.</p>
<p>Importantly, we had developed reporting requirements iteratively with participation from grantees and the Advisory Council from the start. By mid-2017 we had so successfully achieved buy-in that only one grantee court’s judge refused to give us data (the court’s grant manager later sent it to us).</p>

<p>In the course of this process, we established the benchmarks in Table 1 based on best practices and justification for funding. Because this was our initial rollout, we set the specific values low to function more as minimum standards than targets.</p>

<p>Grantee performance data for each benchmark would be generated from the individual level data that courts sent us.

<p>In the end, we found seven grants that we could unequivocally recommend be cut. Two of the seven had effectively never gotten off the ground, and served almost no participants the entire year. The other five served mostly low-risk participants, the type of people that research had shown do not benefit from specialty court programs. Some of these grantees were inevitably disappointed at the decision, but we had so actively worked within the field to develop and justify our processes that they understood why the decision had been made.</p>

<section id="factors-for-success" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="factors-for-success">Factors for success</h2>
<p>In the span of one year, CJD went from collecting a large volume of useless data to a specific, targeted collection of data informed by best practices. The new collection process had high grantee compliance and stakeholder buy-in.</p>
<p>The following factors proved essential to getting to a place where we had useful, reliable data upon which to base future data science efforts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><dl>
<dt>Discontent with status quo</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Advisory Council wanted CJD to play a more active support role in the field. Meanwhile, everyone disliked the existing performance assessment process. As a result, most of the challenges we faced along the way related to implementation rather than defending the status quo on its merits.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>A catalyst for change</dt>
<dd>
<p>Despite existing discontent, it took a funding shortfall to kickstart the process of change. It would have been unlikely for us to be able to create this system <em>a priori</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Continuous, high-quality communication</dt>
<dd>
<p>We could impose rules and requirements all day long, but without good faith engagement from the grantees we could never collect the quality of data we needed. Note that “continuous communication” does not mean “tell them everything you do at every point”. People become overwhelmed by torrents of information.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Humility and flexibility</dt>
<dd>
<p>Had we begun this process assuming we had all of the answers, we would have been dead in the water. Continuous outreach and willingness to take criticism and suggestions shaped the process as it progressed, ultimately producing a better end-product than we could have devised on our own.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>An established program model</dt>
<dd>
<p>Drug courts have been around for decades, with a vast body of supporting research and a community of practitioners and scholars we could speak to. That meant we could focus on implementation and execution instead of determining if the model worked or not.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>Strong leadership support</dt>
<dd>
<p>From the very beginning, we could not have accomplished what we did without the full support and advocacy of our Executive Director.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coda-why-knowledge-transfer-is-vital">Coda: Why knowledge transfer is vital</h2>
<p>I wish I could write a follow-up article about how we started using classification modeling to identify the most successful programs and to promote better approaches and practices; about how we iterated the process through multiple funding cycles, tuning and perfecting it to better meet stakeholder needs. But I cannot.</p>
<p>The performance assessment system we built had some major weaknesses from the outset. It was labor intensive, not required by law, produced no immediate benefit to the agency itself, and was so new it had yet to be entrenched in agency practice. In other words, no institutional incentives worked in its favor. Only the continual push of our Executive Director and myself kept this new performance assessment system going, and once we left the agency, it foundered.</p>
<p>Still, the experience taught me much. I learned first and foremost that programs do not sustain themselves. Most of our attention had been focused on building up the best process we could. Only a minimal effort had been spent on institutionalizing and sustaining it. We had written documentation but no fundamental changes in policy or rule. We had undertaken groundbreaking efforts and built relationships, but had not planned for any meaningful knowledge transfer to other staff. While we had intended to eventually do these things, fate took us away before we could get them in place.</p>
<p>For any kind of change to last, sustainability must be built in from the start. In the moment, these actions can seem low-priority. Policy and rule changes can be arduous and time-consuming. Knowledge transfer from one stably employed staff to another feels redundant and wasteful. But without embedding sustainability, no success will outlast the individual people pushing for it.</p>

  <title>A demonstration of the law of the flowering plants</title>
  <dc:creator>Jonathan Auerbach</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/ideas/tutorials/posts/2023/04/13/flowers.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This tutorial will demonstrate a popular method for predicting the day a flower will bloom. There are many reasons why you might want to predict a bloom date. You might be a scientist studying ecosystems stressed by climate change. Or you might be planning a trip to Amsterdam and would like to time your stay to when the tulips are in bloom. Or maybe you are participating in the annual <a href="https://competition.statistics.gmu.edu/">Cherry Blossom Prediction Competition</a> and want some ideas to help you get started.</p>
<p>In any case, you might be surprised to learn that the day a flower blooms is one of the earliest phenomena studied with systematic data collection and analysis. The mathematical rule developed in the eighteenth century to make these predictions – now called the “law of the flowering plants” – shaped the direction of statistics as a field and is still used by scientists with relatively few changes.</p>
<p>We present the law of the flowering plants as it was stated by Adolphe Quetelet, an influential nineteenth century statistician. Upon completing this tutorial, you will be able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>State the law of the flowering plants and explain how Quetelet derived it.</li>
<li>Reproduce Quetelet’s findings with weather data from the Global Historical Climatology Network.</li>
<li>Replicate Quetelet’s findings with more recent data from the USA National Phenology Network.</li>
<li>Predict the day the lilac will bloom in Brussels in 2023 with weather forecasts from AccuWeather.</li>
<li>Describe how the USA National Phenology Network uses the bloom dates of lilacs to monitor the start of spring.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the tutorial, we challenge you to design an algorithm that beats our predictions. The tutorial uses the <code>R</code> programming language. In particular, the code relies on the following packages:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-law-of-the-flowering-plants">The law of the flowering plants</h2>
<p>We begin by reviewing the law of the flowering plants as it was stated by Adolphe Quetelet. You may already know Quetelet as the inventor of the body mass index. Less known is that Quetelet recorded the bloom dates of hundreds of different plants between 1833 and 1852 at the Brussels Observatory, which he founded and directed. Quetelet reported that a plant flowers when exposed to a specific quantity of heat, measured in degrees of Celsius squared (°C²). For example, he calculated that a lilac blooms when the sum of the daily temperatures squared exceeds 4264°C² following the last frost.</p>
<p>He communicated this law in his <em>Letters addressed to HRH the grand duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="quetelet1846lettres quetelet_1849">(Number 33, 1846; translated 1849)</span> and in his reporting <em>On the climate of Belgium</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="observatoire1834annales quetelet_1857">(Chapter 4, Part 4, 1848; data updated in Part 7, 1857)</span>. A picture of Quetelet and the title page of <em>On the climate of Belgium</em> are displayed in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Quetelet was not the first to study bloom dates. Anthophiles have recorded the dates that flowers bloom for centuries. Written records of cherry trees go back as far as 812 AD in Japan and peach and plum trees as far as 1308 AD in China. Systematic record keeping began a century before Quetelet with Robert Marsham’s <em>Indications of Spring</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="marsham_1789">(1789)</span>.</p>

But Quetelet was the first to systematically study the relationship across a wide variety of plants and derive the amount of heat needed to bloom. An example of Quetelet’s careful record keeping can be seen in Figure 2, one of many tables he reported in his publications.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reproducing-quetelets-law-of-the-flowering-plants">Reproducing Quetelet’s law of the flowering plants</h2>
<p>To reproduce Quetelet’s law, we combine the data in Figure 2 with additional observations from his <em>Letters</em>. We focus on Quetelet’s primary example, the bloom date of the common lilac, <em>Syringa vulgaris</em>, row 18 of Figure 2. We do this because Quetelet carefully describes his methodology for measuring the bloom date of lilacs. For example, Quetelet considers a lilac to have bloomed when “the first corolla opens and shows the stamina.” That event is closest to what the USA Phenology Network describes as “open flowers”, depicted in the center image of Figure 3 below. This detail will become relevant when we attempt to replicate Quetelet’s law in a later section. Note that although we focus on lilacs in this tutorial, the <code>R</code> code is easily edited to predict the day that other plants will bloom.</p>

<p>In the <code>R</code> code below, the five-column tibble <code>lilac</code> contains the date each year that Quetelet observed the lilacs bloom at Brussels Observatory. The first three columns are the month, day, and year the lilacs bloomed between 1839 and 1852. These columns are combined to form the fourth column, the full date the lilacs bloomed. The last column converts the date to the day of the year the lilacs bloomed, abbreviated “doy.” That is, “doy” is the number of days it took for the lilacs bloom following January 1. Both “date” and “doy” representations of Quetelet’s observations will be useful throughout this tutorial.</p>

</div></div><p>The <code>ghcnd_search</code> function returns the maximum and minimum temperature as separate tibbles in a list. In the <code>R</code> code below, we join the tibbles using the <code>reduce</code> function. Note that the temperature is reported in tenths of a degree (i.e.&nbsp;0.1°C) so we divide by 10 before calculating the temperature midrange, our estimate of the daily temperature.</p>
<p>The result is a five-column tibble <code>temp</code>, which contains the year of the temperature record (“year”), the date of the temperature record (“date”), the maximum temperature (“tmax”), the minimum temperature (“tmin”), and the midrange temperature (“temp”). The first 10 rows of the table are below. When you produce the full table yourself, you may notice that a small portion of temperature records are missing. We found that imputing these missing values does not significantly change the results. Therefore, we ignore these days when conducting our analysis.</p>

<p>Reproducing Quetelet’s law is now a simple matter of calculating the sum of the squared daily temperature from the day of last frost until the bloom day. We could use the day of last frost reported in Quetelet’s <em>Letters</em>. However, since we will replicate Quetelet’s analysis with recent data in a later section, we use our own definition of the day of last frost. We define the day of last frost to be the day following the last day the maximum temperature is below 0. The <code>R</code> code below creates the function <code>doy_last_frost</code> to extract the day of last frost from the maximum temperature. To demonstrate this function, we then compare the bloom date with the last frost date in 1839, the first year Quetelet observed.</p>

<p>If Quetelet’s law of the flowering plants is correct, Table 3 has the following interpretation. On March 8, 1839 the lilacs at Brussels Observatory began “collecting” temperature. The lilacs continued to “collect” temperature until May 11, at which point they exceeded their 4264°C² quota and bloomed. We visualize this theory in Figure 4 with the <code>R</code> packages <code>ggplot2</code>, a member of the set of packages that constitute the “tidyverse” <span class="citation" data-cites="Wickham2019">(2019)</span>, and <code>plotly</code>.</p>

<p>We now have all the ingredients necessary to reproduce Quetelet’s findings. Our reproduction is greatly simplified by using the <code>nest</code> function from the <code>tidyr</code> package, another member of the “tidyverse”. For an overview of <code>nest</code>, see the <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html?q=nest#nested-data">“Nested data” section</a> of <span class="citation" data-cites="grolemund2017r">Grolemund and Wickham (2017)</span>. We will group the data by year, nest, calculate the cumulative squared temperature from the frost date to the bloom date within each year, and then unnest. We ignore temperatures below 0°C. That is, temperatures below 0°C are set to 0°C. We do this because it is clear from Quetelet’s derivation of the law that only positive temperatures should be squared. See the next section for details.</p>

<p>The results show that Quetelet’s findings are indeed reproducible. Quetelet estimated that lilacs bloom once exposed to 4264°C² following the last frost. Our reanalysis suggests a similar amount. However, 4264°C² is the overall average across all years – the estimated amount needed to bloom varies year to year. As a result, the average has a 95% confidence interval of approximately 3870°C² to 4660°C². Quetelet was well aware of this variation. He argued it was due to unobserved factors that influence growing conditions and change each year, and he dedicated significant space in his <em>Letters</em> to discuss them.</p>
<p>These unobserved factors limit the accuracy of predictions made using the law. To assess the predictive accuracy of the law, we temporarily ignore the bloom dates Quetelet observed. Instead, we apply the 4264°C² quota to the temperature records at Brussels Observatory to predict the bloom date. We then compare our predictions with the bloom date Quetelet observed. The <code>R</code> code below creates the function <code>doy_prediction</code> to estimate the day the lilac will bloom from temperature records. Table 5 summarizes the accuracy of Quetelet’s law by the mean absolute error and root mean squared error.</p>

<p>Table 5 indicates that predictions made using the law are accurate to within a week on average. For comparison purposes, we also predict the day the lilacs will bloom using the average bloom date between 1839 and 1852. That is, on average the lilac bloomed on April 30 (April 29 on leap years), and we check the accuracy of simply predicting this average date each year. Table 6 indicates the average bloom date yields predictions that are less accurate by an average of two days.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quetelets-derivation-of-the-law-of-the-flowering-plants">Quetelet’s derivation of the law of the flowering plants</h2>
<p>Quetelet believed that, as in physics, universal laws govern social and biological phenomenon. Quetelet was not only inspired by physics to describe social and biological patterns using mathematical formulas. He often took his formulas directly from physics. In fact, you may have already recognized similarities between his law and Newton’s second law of motion.</p>
<p>Quetelet reasoned that temperature exerts a “force” on plants in the same way that gravity exerts a force on a falling object. Newton’s second law states that acceleration is proportional to force. It follows that an object initially at rest and subject to a constant force will travel a distance proportional to time squared. Quetelet simply substituted temperature for time.</p>
<p>We briefly elaborate. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d(t)"> denote the distance an object travels after time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t">. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v(t)%20=%20d'(t)"> denote its speed and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a(t)%20=%20v'(t)"> its acceleration. If acceleration is constant, i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a(t)%20=%20c">,</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v(t)%20=%20%5Cint_0%5Et%20a(s)%20%5C,%20ds%20=%20%5Cint_0%5Et%20c%20%5C,%20ds%20=%20c%20t"></p>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d(t)%20=%20%5Cint_0%5Et%20v(s)%20%5C,%20ds%20=%20%5Cint_0%5Et%20c%20s%20%5C,%20ds%20=%20%5Ctfrac%7Bc%7D%7B2%7D%20t%5E2"></p>
</div>
<p>Quetelet imagined plants experience time in temperature and bloom after “traveling” distance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?d_*">. If a plant is exposed to temperature <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t_i"> on day <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20=%201,%202,%20%5Cldots">, then the bloom date, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_*">, is the first day <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bn_*%7D%20%5Ctfrac%7Bc%7D%7B2%7D%20t_i%5E2%20%5Cgeq%20d_*">. Multiplying both sides of the inequality by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bc%7D">, yields Quetelet’s law: the bloom is the first day, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n_*">, that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bn_*%7D%20t_i%5E2%20%5Cgeq%20%5Ctfrac%7B2%7D%7Bc%7D%20d_*">.</p>
<p>The derivation of laws like the law of the flowering plants was popular in the nineteenth century. But any similarities between the “force” of temperature and the force of gravity are likely coincidental. We are not aware of any biological mechanisms that justify Quetelet’s application of Newton’s law.</p>
<p>Today, the law of the flowering plants is considered a heuristic, or rule of thumb, that approximates complicated biological mechanisms. Like Quetelet, scientists model plants as experiencing time in temperature instead of calendar time. These temperature units are typically called “growing degree days”. Scientists often find that plants may only be sensitive to temperatures in specific ranges or “modified growing degree days”. Although modern statistical methods can greatly improve the accuracy of predictions, laws like Quetelet’s remain popular because they are simple to communicate and easy to replicate, as we demonstrate in the next section.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="replicating-quetelets-law-of-the-flowering-plants">Replicating Quetelet’s law of the flowering plants</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we explained how Quetelet derived the law of the flowering plants. Quetelet believed the law of the flowering plants was universal, describing the bloom date of all flowers around the world and in any year. Whether the law can in fact be considered universal requires replicating Quetelet’s results with new data collected at a different location in a different year.</p>
<p>In this section, we replicate the law of the flowering plants using lilac bloom dates observed by scientists between 1956 and 2009 at 53 locations throughout the Pacific Northwest <span class="citation" data-cites="rosemartin_denny_weltzin_lee_marsh_wilson_mehdipoor_zurita-milla_schwartz_2015">(2015)</span>. The data can be downloaded from the USA National Phenology Network using the <code>rnpn</code> package <span class="citation" data-cites="the_comprehensive_r_archive_network_2022">(2022)</span>. For space considerations, the <code>R</code> code that downloads and cleans the data is provided in the Appendix. Running this code yields the tibble <code>usa_npn</code>. Each row of the tibble corresponds with a bloom date observed at a given site in a given year. There are 31 columns, only seven of which we use in our replication. The remaining columns are documented in the <code>rnpn</code> package, and we will not review them here.</p>

<p>The seventh column we review is “temp”. Each row of “temp” is a tibble of temperature records taken at the nearest station in the Global Historical Climatology Network. The first tibble (again, only the first 10 rows) is displayed in Table 8 below. The columns are defined in the same way as the columns of Table 2, except for “id”, which denotes the location at which the temperature record was made. Table 2 does not have an “id” column because all observations were made at the same site, Brussels Observatory.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to replicate Quetelet’s findings. We will use <code>R</code> code nearly identical to the code we used to reproduce Quetelet’s findings earlier. The main difference is due to the fact that temperature records are dependent across sites within a year. To account for this dependence, we compute the cumulative temperature squared from the last frost to the bloom date for each site and year. We then take the average across all sites within a year. Finally, we calculate the standard error and confidence interval using only the variation of the averages across years. Table 9 displays the results.</p>

<p>Table 9 indicates that Quetelet’s findings are replicable in the sense that the confidence interval calculated using Quetelet’s data (Table 4) overlaps with the confidence interval calculated using the USA lilac data (Table 9). The standard error in Table 9 is smaller than Table 4 because the replication uses 54 years of data compared to Quetelet’s 14. Note that in the <code>R</code> code above, we subtract 1 from “doy” to correct for differences in how the bloom date is reported. This correction is not particularly important; the confidence intervals still overlap when this correction is removed.</p>
<p>We now investigate the accuracy of Quetelet’s law when applied to the USA lilac data. As before, we make use of the <code>doy_prediction</code> function.</p>

<p>Table 10 indicates that the predictions are accurate to within two weeks on average. Recall that the predictions using Quetelet’s own data were accurate to within one week on average (Table 5). We speculate that the decrease in accuracy is due in part to the fact that both Quetelet’s lilacs and the temperature were observed at the same site, Brussels Observatory. In some cases, the USA lilacs were a few miles from where the temperature was recorded.</p>
<p>Although the accuracy of the predictions made using Quetelet’s law is lower when applied to the USA lilac data, Figure 5 indicates that the law produces the correct bloom date on average. The figure plots the predictions made by the law against the actual bloom dates scientists observed. Note that instead of representing prediction-observation pairs as points in a scatter plot, the data are represented using blue contours. We use contours because there are more than 1,500 observations – too many to study using a scatter plot.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Predictions using Quetelet’s law are accurate within about two weeks on average. Author provided, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The contours are easy to interpret. The blue lines are much like a mountain range observed from above. The inner circles are peaks of high elevation in which many prediction-observation pairs co-occur. The outer circles are areas of low elevation in which few prediction-observation pairs co-occur.</p>
<p>The dotted line is the “y = x” line, having zero intercept and unit slope. Prediction-observation pairs that lie on the line indicate perfect predictions. The fact that the dotted line intersects the blue contours at their peak suggests the law derived from Quetelet’s data accurately predicts the typical bloom date of the USA data. This accuracy is impressive given the fact that the USA lilacs were observed more than a century later and on a different continent. The blue curves deviate from the line by about two weeks in the vertical direction, which is consistent with Table 10.</p>
<p>An average accuracy of two weeks might not sound impressive. But it is far more accurate than using the average bloom date Quetelet observed, April 30 (April 29 on leap years). The average bloom date yields predictions that are off by an additional eleven days on average.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predicting-the-day-the-lilac-will-bloom-in-brussels-in-2023">Predicting the day the lilac will bloom in Brussels in 2023</h2>
<p>Any weather forecast can become a flower forecast by applying the law of the flowering plants. In this section, we use the AccuWeather forecast to predict the day a hypothetical lilac will bloom in Brussels in 2023. AccuWeather forecasts daily maximum and minimum temperatures three months into the future. We do not evaluate the quality of these forecasts. The purpose of this section is to simply convert them into flower forecasts.</p>
<p>We use the AccuWeather forecast as it appeared on the webpage <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/be/brussels/27581/january-weather/27581?year=2023">AccuWeather.com</a> on February 19, 2023. AccuWeather reports the forecast for each month on a separate webpage. For reproducibility, we saved each page on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230219151906/https://www.accuweather.com/en/be/brussels/27581/january-weather/27581?year=2023&amp;unit=c">Internet Archive</a>. The following <code>R</code> code creates the function <code>get_weather_table</code> to retrieve each page we saved, extract the forecast contained within that page, and arrange the data as a tibble. The <code>get_weather_table</code> function combines several functions from the <code>rvest</code> package, which is yet another member of the “tidyverse”. In particular, the forecast on each page is contained within the div “monthly-calendar” and can be extracted with the <code>html_nodes</code> and <code>html_text2</code> functions.</p>
<p>Applying the <code>get_weather_table</code> function to the url for each page yields a five column tibble <code>temp_br</code>, with columns defined in the same way as the tibble <code>temp</code>, discussed in previous sections. The first 10 rows are below; the data are also available on the author’s <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jauerbach/miscellaneous/main/temp_br.csv">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>We visualize the predictions in Figure 6, which has the same interpretation as Figure 4. If the temperature forecast and Quetelet’s law are correct, on January 27, 2023 the lilacs in Brussels began “collecting” temperature. The lilacs will continue to “collect” temperature until April 19, at which point they will exceed their 4264°C² quota and bloom.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quetelets-legacy-advocate-mentor-and-perhaps-data-scientist">Quetelet’s legacy: advocate, mentor, and perhaps data scientist</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we stated the law of the flowering plants and explained how Quetelet derived it. We also reproduced and replicated Quetelet’s findings before using his law to predict the day the lilac will bloom in Brussels. We now conclude with a reflection on Quetelet’s legacy.</p>
<p>The law of the flowering plants surely stands the test of time. It continues to be used by scientists – with relatively few changes – to plan harvests, manage pests, and study ecosystems stressed by climate change. We speculate the law’s longevity is due to the fact that it balances simplicity with relatively accurate predictions.</p>
<p>Although Quetelet did not discover the law, he did much to advance it. Quetelet founded an international network for “observations of the periodical phenomena” (in addition to numerous statistical societies and publications, including the precursor to the Royal Statistical Society). Quetelet’s network of 80 stations collected observations throughout Europe from 1841 until 1872. In particular, Quetelet collaborated with Charles Morren – who later coined the term phenology, the name of the field that now studies biological life-cycle events like the timing of flower blooms <span class="citation" data-cites="demarée_rutishauser_2011">(Demarée and Rutishauser 2011)</span>.</p>

</div></div><p>In recent years, the observations collected through phenology networks have become an important resource for understanding the impacts of climate change. For example, the USA National Phenology Network calculates the Spring Bloom Index, which measures the “first day of spring” using the days lilacs are observed to bloom at locations across the United States. The index is then compared to previous years. Figure 7 shows one comparison, called the Return Interval. The Return Interval is much like a p-value, calculating how frequently more extreme spring indices were observed in previous decades. Bloom dates that are uncommonly early (green) or late (purple) may indicate environments stressed by changing climate. Scientists exploit the relationship between temperature and bloom date to extrapolate the index to areas with few observations.</p>

<p>Quetelet’s emphasis on discovering the universal laws he believed govern social and biological phenomenon has not endured. But data scientists continue to appropriate laws from one area of science to study another. For example, data scientists use neural networks and genetic algorithms to study a wide variety of phenomenon unrelated to neuroscience or genetics. Perhaps Quetelet’s appropriation of Newton’s law, in addition to his careful use of data, make him among the first data scientists?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="your-turn-do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-beat-quetelets-law">Your turn: Do you have what it takes to beat Quetelet’s law?</h2>
<p>Quetelet reported that a plant flowers when the sum of the daily temperatures squared exceeds a specific quantity. His prediction rule was state of the art in 1833. But surely you, a twenty-first century data scientist, can do better. Here are some ideas to get you started.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Quetelet squared the temperature before calculating the sum. Would another function of temperature produce a more accurate prediction?</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Remove the square so that a plant flowers once the sum of the daily temperatures exceeds a (different) specific quantity. Does this version of the law produce more accurate predictions? What if you use the daily temperatures cubed? (Beginner)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose a lilac only registers temperatures between 0°C and 10°C. That is, a lilac experiences temperature below the lower limit, 0°C, as 0°C, and above the upper limit, 10°C, as 10°C. Does the accuracy of the predictions improve if you use the temperature the lilac experienced instead of the ambient temperature measured by a weather station? Write a program that finds the lower and upper limits that produce the most accurate predictions. (Intermediate)</p></li>
<li><p>Quetelet used mean absolute error to evaluate the accuracy of his predictions. But his estimate of the specific quantity of heat needed to bloom, 4264°C², does not actually minimize mean absolute error. Write a program that finds the specific quantity that minimizes mean absolute error. Redo part i. and ii. using this function. (Advanced)</p></li>

<li><p>Quetelet calculated the sum of the daily temperature squared between the day of last frost and the bloom date. Would another time interval produce more accurate predictions?</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>We estimated the day of last frost using the last day the maximum temperature was below 0°C. Try estimating the day of last frost by the last day the midrange temperature was below 0°C? Which estimate yields the most accurate predictions? What if you ignore the day of last frost and simply calculate the sum of the daily temperatures squared between February 1 and the bloom date? When you change the time interval, be sure to calculate the new specific quantity of heat needed to bloom. (Beginner)</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program that finds the time interval which yields the best predictions. (Intermediate)</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program that calculates the prediction rule for many different time intervals. Use cross-validation to combine these prediction rules into a single prediction rule. (Advanced)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Quetelet’s law only considers the temperature. Would additional information provide more accurate predictions?</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Is the specific quantity of heat needed to bloom different in years with abnormally cold winters? Would the predictions be more accurate if you use one quantity of heat for years with cold winters and a different quantity of heat for years with warm winters? (Beginner)</p></li>
<li><p>Is the estimated quantity of heat needed to bloom similar for locations close in space and time? Write a program that leverages spatial and temporal correlation to improve the accuracy of the predictions. (Intermediate)</p></li>
<li><p>Some biologists report that a plant must be exposed to a fixed amount of cold temperature in the winter – in addition to a fixed amount of warm temperature in the spring – before it can bloom. Augment the law of the flowering plants to require the accumulation of a specific quantity of cold temperature before the accumulation of a specific quantity of warm temperature. Write a program that uses this new law to predict the day the lilac blooms. (Advanced)</p></li>

  <title>Data science as ‘a rainbow’, and other definitions</title>

<p>What does “data science” mean to you? That’s a question we’ve been asking a lot in recent weeks as part of our <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/career-profiles/">career profiles</a> series of interviews – the first of which, featuring <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/career-profiles/posts/03/28/tamanna-haque.html">Jaguar Land Rover’s Tamanna Haque</a>, was published yesterday.</p>
<p>It’s also a question that was asked recently of Sylvia Richardson, emeritus director of the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge and immediate past president of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS).</p>
<p>Richardson was interviewed by Francesca Dominici, interim co-editor-in-chief of the Harvard Data Science Review. In response to the question “What’s data science for you?”, Richardson said:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s hard to be original, but I was racking my brain for a good metaphor, and came up with the metaphor of a rainbow of interconnected disciplines, sharing the common aim of making the best use of data-rich environments we live in to solve problems in society. So, like in a rainbow, data scientists have to work together to draw out information from data. And the colors must match, [though] they are different. Similarly, there are different but intersecting data science tasks, taking different shapes and forms. As data scientists, we recognize and enjoy diversity, we’re not doing all the same tasks. Nevertheless, there is a backbone, a shape to the rainbow. And for us, this backbone is probability theory, study design, and quantifying uncertainty using statistical thinking. We also know that rainbows change all the time. They don’t last, but they keep reappearing. Data science is also evolving constantly because new questions and new types of data keep arising. In a similar way to the rainbow which is strongly influenced by the atmosphere, one key aspect of data science is that we have a strong link to practice. So, we work together to solve problems from different perspectives, we evolve, we try to be relevant to science and society, and make the best use of the data. [<a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/v27yux58/release/2?from=2089&amp;to=3374">Source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richardson’s view on the meaning and importance of data science has special resonance to me, as editor of Real World Data Science. While president of RSS, Richardson set up the <a href="https://rss.org.uk/policy-campaigns/policy-groups/data-science-task-force/">Data Science Task Force</a> out of which this website emerged. As she explains to Dominici:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… while I was president, I felt a sense of urgency to encourage the RSS to revisit its engagement with data science, and I created a data science task force right at the beginning of my presidency. It didn’t get going earlier because there was COVID to keep us busy! Nevertheless, the Data Science Task Force got underway in 2021 and came up with two major recommendations. One was to give more resources to the practitioners’ community, which led the RSS to create a Real World Data Science online platform. A second direction was to brainstorm on what is still needed for the discipline to thrive. [<a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/v27yux58/release/2?from=17202&amp;to=17799">Source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read (or listen) to Richardson and Dominici’s conversation in full on the <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/v27yux58/release/2">Harvard Data Science Review website</a>.</p>
<p>And we’ll have more <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/career-profiles/">career profiles</a> – and more personal definitions of data science – to share soon. In the meantime, why not tell us what “data science” means to you?</p>

  <title>‘Data science challenges you to keep learning – there’ll always be new advances in the field’</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Hi, Tamanna. Thank you for sharing your career story with Real World Data Science. Please tell us a little about yourself and your role in data science.</strong><br>
I’m Tamanna Haque. I’ve been working at Jaguar Land Rover for nearly four years, recently promoted to lead data scientist working within product engineering. It’s coming up to eight years that I’ve been working in the field, and my areas of interest are the use of machine learning to provide the best products and experiences for my customers and stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>What does your job involve?</strong><br>
My role involves using the connected car and AI to make our products and customer experiences better, whilst leading within our wide data science team too. The data science team in Manchester, UK, originated with myself and one of my teammates – it’s since grown to nearly 40 (cross-sites and countries) and developed into a high-performing, advanced data science team.</p>
<p>What makes us stand out is the nature of our work – we mostly use vehicle data (of participating customers), which is different to a lot of other commercial businesses or teams who’ll focus more on transactional or web data. The data we use lends itself to some pretty interesting projects, and a general futuristic feel here.</p>
<p>I’m particularly interested and active in enabling a more electric and modern luxury future from the use of vehicle data.</p>
<p><strong>What does “data science” mean to you?</strong><br>
The realisation of value! Whether that is added revenue, saved costs or improved growth, I’m led by what data science can do for the business and its customers. The use of data science can open up many exciting, value-adding opportunities.</p>

<p>There are more routes to getting into data science nowadays, but it’s important to not lose sight of fundamentals such as statistics and mathematics. A lot of people can code-up models but it’s fair to say that only a portion of them appreciate how to do this responsibly.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>What do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist?</strong><br>
I’ve always presented myself as a technically astute data scientist, even when entering leadership. But my niche is my ever-growing commercial awareness and passion about our products, customers and business. These aren’t new qualities, but they now align with my professional interests, as well as personal (I’ve been a fan of the Jaguar brand since childhood)!</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into data science?</strong><br>
I did a maths degree at the University of Manchester, where I specialised in statistics. I didn’t do any post-graduate education and this was fine for me.</p>
<p>After graduating, I joined a digital fashion retailer (with a financial services proposition) as an analyst initially. I learned a lot about real-life data and analytics itself, whilst developing a rounded understanding about the business and how to deal with stakeholders cross-functionally. I must have served a few hundred at least(!) and left most of the ‘fancy’ stuff I learned at university aside, whilst getting to grips with so many aspects of commercial analytics. A great way for me to set solid foundations for what followed, and I personally feel this gives me a lens that others who dive straight into data science don’t have.</p>
<p>I was soon attracted to data science because it tapped into what I learned at university and challenges you to keep learning; there’ll always be things to learn, and new advances in the field.</p>
<p><strong>What, or who, first inspired you to become a data scientist?</strong><br>
I have a twin sister, we’ve always been together throughout education. Even before we graduated together, she secured her first role as an analyst. This opened my eyes to data, and data science followed for us both!</p>
<p><strong>What were the hurdles or challenges that you needed to overcome on your route into the profession?</strong><br>
I had a few people tell me I couldn’t do data science, possibly because I didn’t fit the typical data scientist stereotype in several ways. I think attitudes in the field have changed over time though and on a personal level, it’s motivated me to give it everything, and I can’t regret that.</p>
<p><strong>And what are the challenges that you face now, as a working data scientist?</strong><br>
I need to manage my diary well to ensure effectiveness and work-life balance. I’m overseeing people, other projects, doing public speaking and trying to remain hands on. I sometimes block out chunks of time in my diary – I need some meeting-free time to produce quality technical work. I try to finish on time and enjoy a very busy social life with my family and friends. A flexible attitude to how we work helps to keep me happy and energised whilst I’m delivering from various angles.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking back to your earlier roles in data science, how do they compare to your current role?</strong><br>
My current role is very different to my previous roles. I’m continually learning and adapting how I can be a good leader, providing support to a breadth of colleagues (in and outside the team) whilst delivering myself. I’m actively involved in setting and refining our team’s strategy and I’m enjoying leading projects which either deliver high financial impact or help set the path in terms of new tech and/or machine learning capability. There is much more responsibility but it’s easy to stay energised when working on cars and for a business I’ve long admired.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most important thing you learned in your first year on the job?</strong><br>
I should have had more confidence in myself, but this grew – as I adjusted to the new environment I became much more assertive. My domain knowledge and data science expertise combined help to build my self-confidence, credibility and reputation.</p>
<p><strong>What have been your career highlights so far?</strong><br>
I’m most proud of my recent promotion from senior to lead data scientist. Also it was exciting for my family and I when I gained an offer to join Jaguar Land Rover.</p>
<p><strong>Have there been any mistakes or regrets along the way?</strong><br>
No, what’s meant to be will be!</p>
<p><strong>How do you think your role will evolve over the rest of your career?</strong><br>
My progression has been relatively rapid, and I hope I’ve got many, many years ahead of me in my career. It’s hard to say how my role will evolve, I have a blend of responsibilities in my role which combined provide great fulfilment for me at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>If you were starting out in data science now, what would you put at the top of your reading/study list?</strong><br>
A good understanding of analytics and the domain you’re in are my recommended prerequisites to doing data science.</p>
<p>Analytics is an important part of the data science lifecycle, being able to get the data yourself and communicate results with influence, for example, are just a few aspects of analytics which underpin successful data science projects.</p>
<p>Also, without awareness of the business and industry you’re working in, you can become very dependent on others. Data science itself can be quite challenging, so it’s great to have a solid foundation before starting out.</p>
<p><strong>What personal or professional advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist now?</strong><br>
With the level of continuous learning required to just simply keep up, it can be more of a lifestyle and not a job, so this is something to consider!</p>
<p><strong>What do you think will be the main challenges facing data science as a field in the next few years?</strong><br>
I still expect to see a skills gap in the field. There are more routes to getting into data science nowadays, but it’s important to not lose sight of fundamentals such as statistics and mathematics. A lot of people can code-up models but it’s fair to say that only a portion of them appreciate how to do this responsibly, understanding samples versus populations, statistical testing, which type of regularisation to use in a neural network, et cetera.</p>
<p>I also think there’s a challenge of questionable data science products reaching high levels of popularity and usage amongst the public… Some recent developments in this space have been extremely intelligent but raise ethical concerns. Just because something can be done with AI doesn’t mean it should, and my preferences are towards AI being ethical and (ideally) explainable.</p>
