</ul>
<p>We sat down with Andy for a quick-fire Q&amp;A to hear more of what’s in store for next week’s event.</p>
<div class="keyline">
<hr>
</div>
<p><strong>The RSS event takes place one day before the UK government’s AI Safety Summit. Why is it so important for statisticians and data scientists to be involved in the debate over AI safety?</strong><br>
Statistics and data science are at the heart of the AI movement – it’s really a question of taking data and information, and using statistical algorithms to create outputs. That’s at the core of what we do as statisticians and data scientists. Although it’s called AI, it uses mathematical and statistical methods.</p>
<p><strong>The AI Safety Summit focuses on risks posed by certain types of AI systems. Where do you see the biggest risk?</strong><br>
Risk depends upon the purpose and the impact of the AI. It’s very different whether something is being used to inform or recommend or persuade or decide. If it’s a decision-making system, say, there is a bigger risk associated with it if the decision to be made will have an important impact on your life – so, that might be a medical decision or a decision on whether you’re to receive benefits or housing, or how you’re treated in the judicial system. It’s important to understand what the AI is being used for and how much control you have over it, and also how much oversight there is. Will the decision be made solely by an algorithm, or is there human oversight?</p>
<p>There is a particular concern moving forward around misinformation and disinformation. That is a genuine concern, particularly with big elections coming up in the UK and beyond. People are sharing things that they don’t realise are disinformation, so it is really important to understand where the information is coming from, its provenance; that’s incredibly important. We’ve seen with hallucinogenic AI that sometimes there are references given for outputs that don’t actually exist. So we need to constantly scrutinise where information sources are coming from and, if sources are quoted, do they really exist?</p>
<p><strong>The <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/2023/RSS-AI-white-paper-response-v2-2.pdf">RSS policy response</a> to the UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper">AI regulation whitepaper</a> urges investment in a Centre for AI Evaluation Methodology. What informed this recommendation?</strong><br>
The white paper uses the word “proportionate” many, many times. When you talk about safety, inevitably you move into the area of risk, and if you want safety measures to be proportionate, and you want those measures to be based upon risk, then – effectively – you have to understand how you evaluate risk, how you evaluate the probability of something happening, and what the impact might be if it does happen. That naturally lends itself to needing to evaluate both the potential harm but also the potential benefit of using AI. I think the summit is focused more around harm, and the concerns around potential harms, rather than the trade off between harm and benefit. But that was certainly the reason we got into talking about the importance of evaluation, and evaluation is used in other industries where there is high risk. Drug development is an example, as is healthcare, where treatments and new methods are evaluated so that people are informed about both the potential harms and the potential benefits.</p>

<p>We have a really important role to play in focusing attention not only on AI outputs but on inputs. That is an area that hasn’t received enough attention but it is one that statisticians understand incredibly well.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>A lot of the focus of the AI debate is on outputs. Should we be talking more about inputs – the data the models are trained on, where the data is coming from, and issues of quality and bias, etc.?</strong><br>
There should be more discussion of this, yes. Statisticians and data scientists, but statisticians in particular, are trained very much around the data generating process, so we naturally think about how data is gathered, the potential biases in a dataset, and the representation that you need for a study. We understand that the data going in is as important as the outputs produced. And I think it’s becoming more and more necessary to understand where exactly the data is coming from, whether it’s diverse, whether it’s representative of the populations you want to study, and so on. This is an incredibly important area, and provenance of data – like provenance of information – will become ever more important. So, with a large language model, for example, what information is it trained on? Did the developers have permission to use that information? How representative is that information? These sorts of questions need to be addressed, because your outputs will only ever be as good as your inputs.</p>
<p><strong>AI systems are having wide-reaching effects across society. What impact are AI tools having on the work of statisticians and data scientists, and how would you evaluate the impacts so far: good, bad, or neutral?</strong><br>
You have to be a cynic and an evangelist at the same time. There is some very good work being done but also some very naive work. AI is not magic. It requires the same thoroughness and lifecycle management as anything else. Certainly in terms of pattern recognition, image recognition, it’s been very useful. On MRI images, for example, can you reduce the amount of time humans need to spend looking at the data because you have an AI tool helping with the assessment? Of course, the challenge is then, when you have an AI assessment, what do you compare it to? You could compare it to what an expert would assess, but is that a suitable reference point for saying something is a good system, knowing that humans themselves are not perfect? AI systems are able to handle large datasets, large images, very quickly. And so the speed of being able to do that has a potential advantage, although it depends on the level of human oversight. Where we’re seeing these tools being advantageous, I think, is where you have some human oversight but some of the heavy lifting is being done by the AI systems.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope will emerge from the panel debate at the RSS next week? Reaching consensus on such a big, broad topic is unlikely, perhaps, but what are the kinds of things that you’re hoping to learn and take away from the discussion?</strong><br>
We’ve got some very good practitioners on the panel, and I’m hoping that we’ll generate some really good discussion from the panel and some really good questions from the audience. When it comes to the AI conversation generally, there’s a danger that it has focused too much so far on either the academic view of things or the large tech company perspective, so we’re probably missing out a whole tranche of people who are working at the coalface on these things, working in smaller companies. So, I’d like to understand a little bit more about what is happening in that part of industry. I know there’s a big focus on things like building out capability in the UK, and that’s not simply a question of having people with expertise – it’s about having access to things like the right sort of computing environments. So, I think there’s going to be some interesting discussion around what’s holding back industry. Overall, though, what I’d like to see come out of this meeting is a more proportionate response, from people who are working on this on a day-to-day basis. Statisticians are good at that – at coming up with a measured response, an informed response. Do we have the same concerns about the existential threat of AI that have been discussed by some of the larger companies, for example?</p>
<p><strong>Aside from coming along and contributing to this panel discussion, how else can statisticians and data scientists engage with the AI debate and help shape a collective response to this major issue?</strong><br>
I’d certainly encourage them to join the RSS and be a part of our work on this. We want to be a strong voice in the debate on AI because it is underpinned by statistical and mathematical techniques, as I mentioned at the start. We have a really important role to play in focusing attention not only on AI outputs but on inputs. That is an area that hasn’t received enough attention but it is one that statisticians understand incredibly well – and it’s one that brings into discussion issues such as ethics, consent, copyright, etc., and that’s very much where we should be engaging as well.</p>

<p>For years academics have published studies about the limits of automation by AI, suggesting that jobs requiring creativity were the least susceptible to automation. That <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lost-job-chatgpt-made-me-obsolete-copywriter-2023-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">turned</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/02/ai-taking-jobs/">out</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/21/ai-jobs-hollywood-writers-actors-strike">well</a>.</p>
<p>Actually, that’s not completely true: some said that jobs that need a long period of education, like teaching and healthcare, were going to be the hardest of all to automate. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-labs">Oh</a>. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2023/03/GPT-4_medical_benchmarks.pdf">dear</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, all predictions about the limits of AI have been hopelessly wrong. Maybe we need to accept that there aren’t going to be any limits. How is this going to affect our society?</p>
<p>Studies came out from <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161">Stanford</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586">MIT</a> this year, looking at the potential of AI assistants to improve the productivity of office workers. Both came to the same conclusion – that the workers with the lowest ability and least experience were the ones who gained the most in productivity.</p>
<p>In other words, AI has made human knowledge and experience less valuable.</p>
<p>Researchers at Microsoft and Open AI <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375">wrote</a> something important on this phenomenon that I’d like to quote in full:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Large swaths of modern society are predicated on a “grand bargain” in which professional classes invest years or even decades in technical education and training and are [afforded] the exclusive right to practice in their field, social prestige, and above-average compensation.</p>
<p>Technical disruption of this social contract can have implications not only for the medical field but for numerous other knowledge-intensive professions including law, banking, engineering, accounting, and others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk about the fairness of this. Because the AI models didn’t invent medicine, accountancy or engineering. They didn’t learn anything directly from the world – human experts taught AI models how to do these things. And they [the human experts] did it without giving their permission, or even knowing that it was happening.</p>
<p>The large tech companies have sucked up all of human knowledge and culture and now provide access to it for the price of an API call. This is a huge transfer of power and value from humanity to the tech companies.</p>
<p>Biologists in the 1990s found themselves in a very similar position. Celera Genomics was trying to achieve commercial control over the human genome. To stop this happening, the publicly funded Human Genome Project (HGP) resolved to sequence the human genome and release the data for free on a daily basis, before Celera could patent any of it.</p>
<p>The HGP was criticised because of ethical concerns (including concerns about eugenics), and because it was thought to be a huge waste of money. The media attacked it, claiming that a publicly funded initiative could not possibly compete with the commercial sector. Fortunately for humanity, a group of scientists with a vision worked together to make it a success.</p>
<p>And it was a huge success: in purely economic terms it produced nearly $1 trillion in economic impacts for investment of about $4 billion. Apart from the economics, the Human Genome Project accelerated development of the genomic technologies that underlie things like mRNA vaccine technology.</p>
<p>The parallels to our current situation with AI are striking. With OpenAI, just like Celera, we have a commercial enterprise that launched with an open approach to data sharing but eventually changed to a more closed model.</p>
<p>We have commentators suggesting that a publicly funded project to create an open-source AI would be ethically dubious, a waste of money and beyond the competency of the public sector. Where the analogy breaks down is that unlike in the 1990s, we do not have any strong voices arguing on the other side, for openness and the creation of shared AI models for all humanity.</p>
<p>Public funding is needed for an “AI for humanity” project, modelled on the Human Genome Project. How else can we ensure the benefits of AI are spread widely across the global population and not concentrated in the hands of one or two all-powerful technology companies?</p>
<p>We’ll never know what the world would have looked like if we’d let Celera gain control over the human genome. Do we want to know a world where we let technology companies gain total control over artificial intelligence?</p>

<p>Of course. Obviously, there are ethical implications that need to be considered carefully, just as there were for the genome project. At the start of that project, the ethical, legal, and social issues (or ELSI) program was set up. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) devoted about 5% of their total Human Genome Project budgets to the ELSI program and it is now the largest bioethics program in the world. All important ethical issues were considered carefully and resolved without drama.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arent-there-enough-community-efforts-to-build-open-source-ai-models-already">Aren’t there enough community efforts to build open-source AI models already?</h5>
<p>There are good projects producing open-source large language models, like Llama 2 from Meta and Falcon from the TII in the United Arab Emirates. These are not quite as powerful as [Open AI’s] GPT-4 but they prove the concept that open-source models can approach the capabilities of the front-running commercial models; even when produced by a single well-funded lab (and a state-funded lab in the case of the TII). A coordinated international publicly funded project will be needed to surpass commercial models in performance.</p>
<p>In any case, do we want to be dependent on the whims of the famously civic-minded Mark Zuckerberg [CEO of Meta] for access to open-source AI models? We shouldn’t forget that the original Llama model was released with a restrictive licence that was eventually changed to something more open after a community outcry. We are lucky they made this decision. But the future of our societies needs to rely on more than luck.</p>

The limit of the UK Government’s ambition seems to be to set the UK up as a sort of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-pitch-ai-safety-institute-rishi-sunak/">evaluation and testing</a> station for AI models made in Silicon Valley. This is as far from the spirit of the Human Genome Project as it’s possible to be.</p>
<p>Sir John Sulston, the leader of the HGP in the UK, was a Nobel Prize-winning scientific hero who wanted to stop Celera Genomics from gaining monopolistic control over the human genome at all costs. The current UK ambition would be like reducing the Human Genome Project to merely testing Celera Genomics’ data for errors.</p>

<p>It may not be possible to avoid this. But governments will at least be able to mitigate societal disruption if they can redistribute some of the wealth gained via AI (e.g., via universal basic income). They will not be able to do this if all of the wealth accrues to only one or two technology companies based in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>This summer, the UK Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) published its report on <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/data-sharing-and-linkage-for-the-public-good/">Data Sharing and Linkage for the Public Good</a>. In the report, the OSR notes that the value of sharing and linking data has become widely recognised within government, though there remain areas of challenge and uncertainties about “the public’s attitude to, and confidence in, data sharing.”</p>
<p>The report also warns that “unless significant changes are implemented… progress that has been made could be lost and the potential for data sharing and linkage to deliver public good will not be achieved.”</p>
<p>To find out more about the report and its recommendations for change, we sat down with Helen Miller-Bakewell, OSR’s head of development and impact. Listen to the full interview below or on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Hello, I’m Brian Tarran, editor of realworlddatascience.net. And welcome to another Real World Data Science interview. Today I’m speaking with Helen Miller-Bakewell of the Office for Statistics Regulation. And we’re talking about the Office’s July 2023 report, Data Sharing and Linkage for the Public Good. In this report, the OSR reviews progress that has been made towards sharing and linking data for the public good. It says that the value of sharing and linking data has become widely recognised within government, though there remain areas of challenge and uncertainties about, quote, the public’s attitude to and confidence in data sharing. The report warns that quote, unless significant changes are implemented, the OSR is concerned that progress that has been made could be lost and the potential for data sharing and linkage to deliver public good will not be achieved. In my interview with Helen, we talk about some of the key highlights and findings of the report some of its main recommendations, some examples of data sharing and linkage that are going on now within government. So let’s hand over now to Helen, who will begin by introducing herself, her role within OSR and some of the background to the report.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
So I’m Helen, Helen Miller-Bakewell, I have an official title of head of development and impact within OSR. OSR as a whole, our kind of formal job is to regulate statistics produced by government, we are the regulatory arm of the UK Statistics Authority. And our aim is to work towards statistics that serves the public good, and a government that produces and uses statistics analysis in a way that means the public can feel confident in them, and the analysis that that’s done and how they’re used. Within OSR, I used to be a regulator of statistics, I was out there looking at official statistics on crime and security, holding them up against our code of practice for statistics, which sets the standards that we would like to see government statistics meet. In my role now I actually oversee a few of our cross organisation functions, that all are designed to try and improve the way that OSR as a whole works, and to do work that can support the statistical system as a whole. And the most relevant one for today is the data and methods function. And a key piece of work that that function has been working on for the last year is looking at how data sharing and linkage is done across government, and that supports one of OSR’s wider interests and ambitions. One of our ambitions for the current five years is to make greater data available in a secure way for research and evaluation. That’s what this report that we’re going to be talking about has contributed to.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Before we get stuck into the report, maybe it’s worth setting out what does OSR mean when it’s talking about data sharing and linkage? What’s the driver for this being a kind of a priority, something that OSR wants to encourage and to see happen? What are the public benefits that you hope to accrue from it?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
The general premise that’s underpinned the report, and the reason that we have been a champion and advocate for date sharing and linkage for a while, is that we think data can be more powerful when it’s linked, and when it’s made accessible, in a secure way, to a wider audience for analysis. And it can offer more insights and better fulfil its potential to serve the public goods. And again, I keep saying serve the public goods. Within OSR, we very much think that statistics analysis, it shouldn’t just be for government, for decision makers in government, it should be available to the public, to all stakeholders, really, who wants to use it to make decisions hold government to account.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So for people reading this or listening to this, who haven’t yet had a chance to dig into the report – and it’s very interesting report – what are the key messages that you want to share with people? What is the, I guess, what’s the assessment of the current state of data sharing and linkage?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
I think some of the key messages do echo what other reports have said in this space, which is that there really has been some excellent progress in terms of data sharing and data linkage. We last reported on data sharing and linkage back in 2018 and 2019, when the DA was kind of coming into force and things were starting to move slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Sorry to interrupt you. But what is the DEA did you say?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
It’s the Digital Economy Act. So there was some amendments to the DEA, it created new, new powers to enable greater sharing of data for research and statistics, and it put the Office for National Statistics at the centre of those powers. It kind of gave ONS greater powers to ask other departments across the government to share data with them for research and statistical purposes. And the UK Statistics Authority as well have powers to accredit researcher and accredit processing environments so that people can have access to more data as well across governments.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So your last report was in 2018, 2019 time. There’s been good progress, you say, since then. I wanted to ask you about some good examples of data linkage that you’ve seen in that time. Maybe the obvious one is Covid, I’m guessing. The pandemic, that offered a lot of opportunities for linking different datasets together. But are there– is that it? Or are there others that you want to highlight?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
I think the pandemic definitely provided a really strong impetus to share data, to link data. And I think, you know, we saw things done which hadn’t been possible previously, it broke down barriers, and was a kind of an excellent enabler, which is fantastic, because it was a crisis situation. And actually, yes, one of the examples that I would highlight, and I know others in OSR would highlight that was doing Covid, was Office for National Statistics estimates of Covid-19 mortality rates among different ethnic groups, and that drew on census data, it drew on death registration data at your on hospital episode statistics, it drew on data from lots of different places to create some really, really important analysis. It’s exciting to be able to say now that there are good examples of data sharing and linkage across different topic areas and different organisations. And I think if you spoke to regulators in OSR working in different domains, they will each have like their favourite examples of, of data sharing and linkage. Having worked in crime and security regulation myself, the one that comes straight to mind is Data First, which is data linkage project led by Ministry of Justice, working with ADR UK – another one, I don’t have to say full often, Administrative Data Research UK – and that’s done a fantastic job of kind of opening up access again, in a secure way, a real focus on security, to a wealth of data from across MOJ systems, sometimes horrible, clunky legacy systems – I hope none won’t be offended if I say that – but making it valuable because people can, you know, to a greater extent now link it and link it to data from other departments as well.</p>
<p>I did ask a couple of colleagues if they wanted to throw me any other examples of data sharing and linkage that they particularly think highly of, and another one that came up was the Registration and Population Interaction Database, RAPID database, which has been created by DWP [Department for Work and Pensions]. And that provides that brings together data, information from DWP, HMRC [His Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs] and local authorities to try and give a view of citizens’ interactions across the breadth of DWP services. What the report does say is, although we have these good examples, there are still barriers and challenges to doing data sharing and linkage. And that, that can, can be true across the whole process, right from getting support for the idea, through the practical steps of finding out what data is available, where, who owns it, how you can get to it, and then actually doing the linkage bit technically at the end. So we’ve been in a situation where things definitely have improved. But it’s, in many cases, it is not easy or efficient yet to share or link data. Our report talks about different barriers we heard about during the course of interviews with stakeholders, that we’ve encountered through our regulatory work as well. And we make 16 – to be precise – recommendations for how we could, or how government could, could start to chip away at those to, to improve the situation going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah, and I would like to talk about some of those recommendations, I guess the more technical side of the recommendations, a bit, a bit later. One thing I wanted to ask you now about was about a word that sort of jumped out at me in, in the report was this idea of needing there to be a social licence for data sharing. And in the report, social licence has, has been defined as the, like, the level of acceptance or approval in local communities for data linkage projects. Now, I guess for something like the pandemic, right, you can argue that there is a kind of an implicit social licence, it was an emergency situation, there was, you know, people at risk. So that sort of use case was kind of justified, but I was curious about how social licences for these things can best be established and, and maintained, because that’s about kind of interaction with the public, right? You know, you could put a load of government statisticians and data scientists into a room and say, what could you do with this, all this data and how you could, could you link it all together? And they’d get very excited about it? But actually, then, how do you then take that to the public and convince them that it’s a good idea, or are there other ways of making sure this social licence has been obtained?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
So, social licence and public engagement were one of the topics that was good, most consistently mentioned across the interview– interviews we held. And yeah, there just seemed to be a consensus which we would support that those working on data sharing and linkage should be prioritising public engagement around their work, both to kind of gauge the amount of social licence that there might be, or any sticking points, and potentially start to build social licence as well. And I think, you know, it’s really great to see people thinking like that, and I would actually say as well, it seems to be a recurring theme. And it’s really nice to see that having prominence. Another finding from the interviews was, you know, the flip side of this, yes, people think it’s important, but often people can not quite know how to approach public engagement, building social licence. And there are actually a few examples we highlight in the report where we, where we think public engagement has been done, done well, hopefully, to kind of inspire people. I would say, you know, I have a few kind of overarching thoughts on what can be important. And I think it, it comes so much to trust and trustworthiness. And I think the way, some ways that you can support trust with the public are transparency, saying what you’re going to do and why, and how, and actually the outcomes as well, when possible, let’s sit closing the circle. Thinking about this interview, I remembered OSR ran a public dialogue last year with ADR UK. And we were trying to talk to members of the public about what they understand by the public good of statistics and data. And one of the messages that came up there was people want to feel the impact their data and feel that outcome. And they don’t always feel they get that knowledge back. Like, what, what was, so what was the outcome of you having my data and doing these things that you kind of said you would do? So yeah, transparency, and then kind of linked to that, I guess, like continuous engagement, and considered engagement. And the public is not a homogenous group, there will be different groups that are important to engage for different data sharing, different data linkage projects, and you kind of need to consider who are the people you need to really engage with for your specific initiatives. And then it’s, I’m afraid you can’t just do one survey or one focus group, there needs to be some kind of mechanism for getting more continuous engagement to keep an eye on actually, how are people feeling now, because we know that social licence and people’s feelings about sharing data, it can be context dependent, it can be time dependent. And actually the first couple of recommendations in the report, so right there at one and two, number one is about the value of trackers like CDEI’s [Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation] Public Attitudes Survey, which, you know, are run on a semi-regular basis to try and track how the public are feeling at a high level about questions around data. And then our second recommendation is about having an organisation that can do more to produce guidance and support people doing research to do public engagement well.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Does the mission statement of statistics for the public good, does that kind of help guide the approach, right? So any data linkage, data sharing project, you need to understand, you need to think about okay, what’s the public good that we’re trying to achieve here? And then that becomes your, almost the point, the focal point of the discussion with the public about why we want to do this and why we think there’ll be a benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Absolutely. This focus on the public good is what we always come back to in, in OSR. And again, it is something that can sometimes slightly differentiate us from other organisations in this space where there may be a very internal government focus. Yeah, absolutely. What’s the outcome that’s seeking to be achieved? And will we achieve it? Did we achieve it?</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
One of the parts of the report that I was quite interested in was the four future scenarios. The task you set yourself was to look five years from, from now at where we might be, and I guess give a range of, like, scenarios in which data linkage is great, and everyone’s doing it and it’s fully supported, down to it’s, you know, it’s happening on a piecemeal basis or not at all. So what I wanted to understand was, how those scena– whether any of those scenarios are more likely than others to emerge, and whether the kind of likelihood of those scenarios emerging are dependent on certain of your recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
The scenarios just allowed us to explore in a theoretical way, like, yeah, where, where could we end up? We hope the 16 recommendations we’ve made, taken together, if they could all be fully delivered, could lead us towards that ultimate scenario of data sharing and linkage for the public good. And you can put quite neatly different recommendations against different bits of that scenario to help get, get us there. I think if, if I reflect on the scenarios like right now, the one that feels like most familiar to me is data sharing and linkage in silos. We’ve kind of spoken a little bit earlier already about how there are some areas of government and some topic areas and some organisations that are doing some really brilliant work. And I could see quite a realistic scenario where that kind of becomes more entrenched over, over the next five years. But, you know, maybe that’s actually just realistic, right? Maybe it’s unrealistic to expect that every organisation [in] government with different, different sizes, different funding, different priorities, could, could end up in exactly the same place on date sharing and linkage, all at the kind of, the top level. But I do, I do think if we can chip away at the recommendations we’ve made, then every organisation could improve on their starting point and move towards that, that scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Okay, so let’s talk about some of the recommendations of how we get there. And there were a couple of areas I particularly wanted to focus on. One was talking about career frameworks, and having those kind of reflect, and I guess, reward the skills of those who are working on data and data linkage projects. So I was kind of wondering, you know, are there, are these skills that are kind of currently either underserved or under recognised within the existing career frameworks? And if so, how do we change that? Or was that is that beyond the scope of your report to recommend that?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
I think the situation across government is perhaps relatively complicated here. And I think what we, what we’d really like to see, essentially, is a situation where people in roles, in data roles, basically feel valued, and they can see a clear career pathway for them within government. And I think what we have at the moment is a variety of career frameworks that support people working in in roles with data and a decentralised pay model. Which means pay scales across, across roles can, can – and frameworks – can vary. You can see intuitively, how that has the potential to kind of create confusion for individuals – like well, which career framework should I look at – and, and then on the pay side, the potential to create kind of skills sink, where people want to go and work particular areas simply because they can be paid more, and in some cases it’s a considerable amount more, actually. And the reason I say it’s complicated is because, I mean, to some extent, this, what we have, is appropriate. People who work on data and sharing and linkage projects can come from lots of different analytical backgrounds – like, you could have a statistician or a social researcher or a data scientist or data architect, they could all be working on a, on a data sharing project, shall we say. And actually, it kind of makes sense that people in those kind of different roles might have different career frameworks and paths. And similarly, as I say, pay is decentralised, I don’t think OSR has much power to change too much there. But, you can see there are arguments for departments being able to have their own say on what skills they need to kind of pay more for in different circumstances at different times to, to bolster things. However, what we have said in the report, what we call for, and what we will try and speak to people who own frameworks to try and facilitate, is just a bit more awareness between people who own different frameworks about what else is out there, and a bit more consistency, therefore, about how different data skills perhaps are reflected and where they’re reflected in different frameworks. So we’re not asking for one single framework, I don’t think that would be practical, or particularly serve people working in data very well. But yeah, like more awareness, better joined up working, more consistent use of frameworks in, in job adverts, for example, just to help people see more clarity about their careers and where they can take them.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
I was at an event recently where, you know, people working in, in data science or data, data kind of roles in government, were talking about how, like, the sort of career pathways and that there’s a feeling that technical skills, or growing technical skills aren’t always as well rewarded as greater sort of managerial responsibilities, so that if you become a, someone who’s excellent at being able to solve the, the knotty problems of data linkage and sharing, right, you might not be as well compensated for that as you might be if you were, say, running a team of 20, 30 people and sort of not actually applying those technical skills on a day-to-day basis. So it’s, I guess that was where my question was coming from was, is it that sort of thing that we kind of need to, need to address in some way? But, again, that might be beyond the scope of, you know, what you were looking at it on this particular matter?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Well, I think it’s something for us to think more about, if I’m honest. We have committed ourselves to a follow on report for this. And we want to kind of take a look at the recommendations next year and see, you know, how far everything’s got. So, you know, any, any additional bits that we haven’t covered in this first report are good for us to think about. I think the situation you’ve just outlined sounds very familiar, to be honest, and not just across data science, across a whole load of roles where, yeah, actually your technical skills, they take you really well to middle management, but then there often comes a point where, if you want to go higher and have greater remuneration, you might have to move more to those softer skills, those managerial skills. That’s something we can think a bit more about, actually. And when we do have conversations with those who we kind of pointed to for the frameworks recommendation, maybe have a look into it a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
This is, I guess, some somewhat related to the previous point. But the other aspect of the recommendations that jumped out to me were the discussion around quality metadata and documentation, standardisation and things like that as being priorities for effective data linkage, these are the things that need to be in place. But again, when you chat to researchers, not just in government but all over the place, these less glamorous aspects of data management are kind of underappreciated. And often teams are, the way that, the way teams work, the way projects work is you finish one, you move on to the next, you don’t really want to think too much about the one that you just worked on, because you’ve got a new priority or a new round of funding or whatever it is. So how do we convince senior leaders that, that there are sufficient resources for this sort of work that needs to be done? It might not sort of deliver necessarily immediate value and benefits, but it’s about kind of accruing the kind of infrastructure, I guess, to, to make sure that data sharing and linkage, you can achieve your, you know, your most optimistic vision of data sharing and linkage being widespread in government.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Yeah, I think it’s a really important question. And yeah, having worked as a statistician as well, before I came into this world of regulation, yep, I recognise what you just described. And, you know, I think it’s always going to be a challenge in these kind of fast-paced multiple priority environments, where often people are resource stretched in terms of people, time, money, all those things together. Though, I think there’s a couple of tacks. One, I think, is maybe improving the data literacy of senior leaders, and trying to give them a greater understanding of, of data, how it’s used, and around these issues of kind of standardisation, and why they’re why they’re so important. And, actually, a couple of the recommendations earlier on in the report, in the people section, are around improving the– or strengthening the statistical literacy and the data literacy of senior leaders and recommending they go on, for example, the Data Science Campus in ONS run a master class for senior leaders across the service. So I think there was a kind of a bit of a, an education thing. And yeah, I guess, you know, part of that is setting out, like, what are the benefits? And what are the risks of not doing this? I think that, you know, here comes a role for people like OSR in setting expectations, especially in the world of official statistics, it is completely within our power to set the expectation for what government statistics should be doing with regards to metadata, or kind of following, following best practice and things like that. Our code of practice for statistics does do that to some extent already. And us as well, there’s a role for us in demonstrating the benefits and saying why we’re asking people to do these things and, and what’s good when it, when it goes well. I was thinking about this, and it drew to mind the EAST Framework. I don’t know if you’ve come across that. It’s a framework that was introduced to me by the Behavioural Insights Team for bringing about change and what you– what interventions need to be if they’re going to be successful, and it’s Easy, Attractive, Social and Timely. And I think when we and when other organisations who are kind of working on metadata standardisation, like the Central Digital Data Office, like Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, there’s, you know, there’s a few players here. We need to be keeping these, the EAST in mind as we design to try and help people kind of come on board with things more easily. And yeah, recommendation 16 in the report, the final one, is about standardisation and about, there are lots of players in this space and can we, can we bring them together a bit to be even more effective? So that’s, that’s definitely something we’ll be looking at in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And you said that there’ll be a follow up report soon. When is that? When are you targeting?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
We’re planning next summer. So last time when we did our first report on Joined-up Data in 2018. And then we did a follow on one year on in 2019. We found that was quite an effective way to, for us and others, to kind of build and maintain momentum. And yeah, again, you know, feels a bit unfair almost to just put out a load of recommendations, and then then leave, leave the world to it. We’d like to see if we can help facilitate and then tell people how we’ve been getting on.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And I’m guessing it’s not, you’re not looking for all recommend– 16 recommendations to be implemented by next year. But it’s, are we making steps towards some of them? Are we are we heading in the right direction?</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
You know, let’s practice what we preach. A bit of transparency. Yeah, are we heading in the right direction? And if we’re not, you know, is there a plan? I’d love to be optimistic. That optimistic. I wouldn’t expect that we can just put ticks against all 16 recommendations next year. But hopefully, yeah, we can, we could do some progress bars.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Excellent. Well, we should probably schedule a follow up interview for a year’s time then. But Helen, thank you very much for your time today.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Oh, you’re very welcome. And if anyone, any of your listeners interested in, in the report, please do get in touch with OSR. We’d be very happy to talk about the report that we’ve just written or about, you know what we’re doing. Following on from that? Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So we’ll definitely put a link to the report in the show notes. So once again, Helen, thank you very much for joining us.</p>
<p><strong>Helen Miller-Bakewell</strong><br>
Oh, you’re welcome. Thank you.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A passion for maths and solving mathematical problems led Niclas Thomas to a PhD in machine learning with a focus on medical research. But then a conversation with a recruiter steered his career towards data science in the retail sphere. After stints at Tesco, Sainsbury’s, and Gousto, Thomas is now head of data science for Next, the clothing retailer.</p>
<p>In this interview with Real World Data Science, Thomas reflects on his career journey so far, from hands-on coding work to team leadership and management. He also argues for the importance of communication and storytelling as part of the data science skill set.</p>

<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Niclas Thomas, thank you for joining us today. I hope you’re well.</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I am indeed thanks. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Today we’re meeting because we want to find out a little bit about your career in data science, how you got into it, what you’re doing now, where you see both your career and data science as a profession going next. So do you mind– can we start by giving us a brief introduction to who Niclas Thomas is?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, of course. Yeah. So I’m currently working as head of data science at Next. My background is academia originally, a maths degree. I did my PhD in machine learning, and more in medical research, so more of an applied machine learning position where the idea was to try and predict, ultimately, predict disease from a given sample of data from blood – can you actually predict future disease? – which I think is a really interesting area; I love medical research. And then [I] switched over to more commercial role and worked in several retail data science roles: so, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Gousto, and then now, as I said, currently head of data science at Next, where I run a team, and I imagine most listeners will be familiar with what Next do: a retail, a clothing brand on the whole, where the idea is, obviously to sell some great stuff, great products and put the right product in front of the right customer.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Can you tell us, what does your job involve? What are your sort of main tasks and responsibilities in that role?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, so I suppose I’m lucky enough to have been head of data science at several different companies: Sainsbury’s, Gousto, and Next. So it’s always interesting to compare the role of the head of data science in each of those three. At the moment, I think there’s a core focus on, well, ultimately making sure the teams are efficient as possible. And that really means just making sure our tech stack – what tools, what programming languages, what software we use on a day to day basis – is set up for success and make sure the team have what they need to be able to do the job as efficiently as possible, whether that’s using Python or R, whether that’s how we develop code, and how we work with other people as well, being a big part of that, then. So how do we work with other software engineers? How do we work with web developers, then, to make sure that the work we do actually gets in the hands of the business and ultimately in the hands of the customer. So that’s one aspect: it’s just making sure the team is set up for success, both in terms of the ways they work and what tools they have to work as well, then. I guess the other side of that coin is what we actually work on. So understanding the value of potential work we could do, and helping the team understand what that value is, and, and ultimately giving direction of what things we want to work on next. Obviously, that’s not my decision in isolation, but understanding on the one hand, what other stakeholders want to do, what my superiors wants to do, as well. And trying to put that all into the mix to understand these are the next best projects to work on given a finite amount of people to work on these problems. And then ultimately, then, the last part, then, is ultimately helping the team deliver those projects, those products as well then, which usually means calling on my experience of having solved these problems myself, either directly when I was earlier in my career or indirectly through leading others then or, you know, being the head of a team and working with some other great people and to learn from their experiences as well.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
What does data science mean to you, personally? I’m not asking you to define it for everybody. But for you, what is what is data science?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, I wish I’d come up over the years with a great definition of this. But yeah, I mean, really, it just, I mean, at the very highest level, it just means using data to drive business value, I suppose, as I guess in my– which probably reflects the fact that it’s more of a business role that I have. But I think that in its broadest sense, I think that’s true: using data to drive insights and make decisions for the business. There are more, I guess, detailed definitions of that. So, for example, the way I’ve always differentiated between data analytics and data science is that if you want to make repeated decisions on a daily or weekly basis, then that’s when it becomes more about a data science question versus a data analytics question, because data analytics is generally about answering large one off ad hoc questions, rather than making the same decision over and over again and using methods appropriate for that. But, ultimately, that’s what data science means to me, I think: making repeated decisions using data and the scientific method to use data for good.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
And so what do you think is your most important skill as a data scientist given that definition that you have of data science?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
In my role, I suppose communication ultimately becomes the most important thing. I’d say definitely earlier in my career, and I think if you’re the person actually delivering and implementing the algorithm, I think that the technical skill set obviously is really important then. But ultimately, I almost see my role as the head of data science as a hybrid– as a link between my team and the rest of the business, then. So it’s really about being able to, on the one hand, translate technical concepts into non technical descriptions of what we’re actually doing, making sure the rest of the business can understand and vice versa, then making sure I understand the business process and business terminology well enough to be able to translate that for the team, as and when needed, into a vision for a project, a product, then, and develop a strategy for that. So I think that the communication both in the strictest sense of being able to talk that through with, with my team, with other team members, with stakeholders, as well, but also more in the looser sense, then, of being able to define that strategy, being able to define what the roadmap for a particular project or a product might look like.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Can you talk us through your so your education and your training that led up to your kind of first data science job, your first data science role.</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I suppose the first time, the first time I– actually, I’d never heard about it, I think, when a recruiter approached me. This is probably going back into 2014, when I was maybe eight months into my postdoc after my PhD. I think– obviously it did exist before that, although I suppose the terminology wasn’t quite as widespread going back almost 10 years now where the term is a lot more rife. So my original background, I did a master’s in maths originally, four years. And then I remember being– the last year of that, then, I was applying for a few jobs, and I applied for one at the Met Office, where the focus obviously was predicting weather, forecasting. And I wasn’t successful in that job. But I did notice that the, on the job spec at the time, it was PhD preferred was one of the specs on that role. It was probably the first time I thought about taking on a PhD as more of a career move rather than as the natural progression to an academic career, more of a business career move if you like, then of actually how it can help you in more business settings. So that was at least when I decided to do my PhD and thought it’s certainly not going to be– and this was back in 2008, so at the time of the financial issues at the time when getting jobs was harder anyway, so it felt like a win-win of doing something that would be– I was clear I wanted to work in a data role of some sort. And that combined with the fact that I thought it would be a good career move and the financial climate at the time wasn’t brilliant. So I took on a PhD then. And then in terms of actually getting into, into my first data science position was, as I said, just after I finished my PhD, I had been working about six months, eight months as a postdoc, and then a recruiter just described a role that was available at Tesco at the time. And it sounded a lot of what I was doing in my current postdoc role at the time – making predictions based on data and exactly the same techniques – sounded really interesting. And it must have been the way the recruiter sold it at the time as well then, because it’s something I was really keen to take on and then made my move off the back of that then. So yeah, kind of moved into it a little bit, I guess, semi deliberately from taking a PhD on first, but always with the view of moving over to a business role at some point after that.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
But it wasn’t like you started out your further education thinking, “I want to be a data scientist, what do I need to do to kind of get there? What are the subjects I need to focus on? What are the topics I need to research?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, it certainly wasn’t by design at the very start of my journey. I fell in love with math, really, and just fell into data science because of that, really, I loved numbers and loved solving maths problems. So that’s why I did a degree in it first of all, then and certainly, you know, even midway through my degree, then I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do. It was more, as you say, just by chance, then, that there were a few opportune moments that came around then, that opportunities came around at the right time to fall into that career.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Doing a PhD in machine learning as you did, that was quite a – in hindsight – a smart choice of PhD to pursue, I think, right?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think so. Yeah, I suppose it was– still even at that stage it wasn’t necessarily, again, the terminology ‘data science’ wasn’t really around. Certainly, when I started my PhD in 2009 2010. It wasn’t really terminology, at least it may have been in usage a little bit in terms of being on, you know, if you look for jobs on LinkedIn or Indeed, but it certainly wasn’t terminology that that I would have been particularly familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Your first job in data science was at Tesco. You mentioned that you were you were kind of recruited to that role there. How does it compare to your current role? So I guess, you know, what’s the difference between being a data scientist versus head of data science as you are now?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, I think there are probably more similarities than differences, I would say. We were quite lucky in the setup in Tesco that the recruitment strategy seemed to be more focused around people who already had some experience in, generally, either already had business experience or a PhD. So we were fairly independent in solving our own– the project that we were working on and working on that. Not necessarily with the head of data science guiding us, you know, day by day, in terms of the actual nitty gritty and the technical detail, which is great, then. So it did mean that we had responsibility and ownership for our product quite early on. So yeah, I really enjoyed that. I suppose I was writing a lot more code in those days than I do now. I rarely, if ever write code at the moment. So I think that’s probably true for the last maybe three or four years, I think, only occasionally getting my hands dirty. And even when it is, it’s not really to build an algorithm, it’s more to inquire about what data we have to solve the algorithm then. So even when I do get my hands dirty, it’s more in the very early stages of the whole algorithm development lifecycle. So I think that’s probably the biggest difference is just the actual ownership of development there – probably expected, I would say, but it’s– I think that’s one of the beauties of being in your first job or two in data science. I think the– I think in most places I’ve seen, I think you’ll get ownership of, of the work, the stuff that you work on, on a day to day basis, quite early on. And you’ll be expected to contribute code and ideas for that as well, which I think most people would love. I certainly loved it at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
What was the most important thing you learned in your first year in that job?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think, again, it’s probably a lot around the ways of working, I would say – of the various ways you can [work], which I never really thought about it before. Working in academia, it was quite isolated, I suppose. You work on your own project, you work on your own work and don’t really– or at least, I found I didn’t really work with anyone else that much. Maybe that was the nature of my work as well, we’d obviously be dependent on people working in a lab to get data. But I think the day to day work, I was working quite in isolation, whereas the team aspect of working, I think, was a steep learning curve then – so agile methodology, and everything around that, which was very, very new to me. And the various ways you can do that. I’m generally not someone for overly putting processes in place in a team, only where necessary. But I think there’s some great learnings from that as well. It certainly started to shape how I think I would want to run a team if and when I got to that position.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So, Nick, what have been your career highlights so far?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think in terms of– there was one product we built in Sainsbury’s in particular. So in terms of, on a product level of replenishment. So how do you most efficiently get products from the back of the store onto the shelves of an individual store? And what’s the most optimal strategy to do that, which I love for a variety of reasons. A, it was one of the first full data science products that we had deployed and worked on as a team in Sainsbury’s. So there was that kind of milestone about it. I think it also stood out as a really nice move away from classic machine learning – i.e., making a prediction, a classification model – to something that was a bit more operations research based and more based on optimization. So using graph theory, making a graph network of a store. And using that to solve the problem of taking a route through the store, for example, a bit like a Google Maps for a store basically, was how we always pitched it to our stakeholders, and how can you choose the best route and again, moving more into a bit more of a vehicle routing problem, then: if you’ve got two different trolleys, how do you decide what items to put on trolley one versus trolley two? So there’s loads of interesting stuff on the technical side of things and it was, again, I felt it was probably one of the highlights – as well as the end product, it was also the one I worked on at the very start. So actually, the understanding whether it would be possible to do that, what kind of technical approach. So I think certainly from a product perspective, that’s probably stuck in my mind. Aside from that, on a more personal level, I guess, I did decide to write a book off the back of my PhD. Just mainly on my experiences from my PhD and postdoc. I mean, it’s not like a confessional. But more on the– just working with non data scientists and making it more accessible was really what I really focused on there. So having worked with clinicians, immunologists and others as part of the medical research that I did, I felt that data can be accessible if you pitch it in a way and make it easy to use. And so that was the purpose of what was largely an educational textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Do you want to give a short plug for the book, what it’s called and where people can find it?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, so it’s, Data Science for Immunologists is the name of the book. It’s available on Amazon. I’m one of the two co-authors on that then. And we do have a website, <a href="https://datascienceforimmunologists.com/">datascienceforimmunologists.com</a>, as well then if you did want to visit and you can either buy the book, there’s a link on that website or just go straight to Amazon and it’s available there.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
This next question, we’ve gone from highlights to lowlights. Have there been any mistakes or regrets that you’ve had along the way in your data science career so far?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
The main mistakes I think I’ve made before is not valuing, A, communication or soft skills, but B, the leadership and management as well then. And I think especially it’s something, when working at Gousto as well that was something that was a big focus of the team and something that I really took from my time there as well was the, I guess, the art of good management and good leadership, you know, what the difference is between the two. So I wouldn’t say there’s any one bang event that’s a mistake or regret, but it’s probably, as ever, it’s probably I would have put more emphasis on it sooner had I known that how important those skills would be.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
Yeah, but I think that’s understandable to a certain extent. If you’re coming from, I guess, a role that’s very hands on, doing things yourself, getting into the messy details of a project, it can sometimes be hard to kind of take a step back and adopt more of a kind of leadership, management position, can’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely. I would agree with that. And I think it’s also, I’d probably say for a lot of people starting out, and certainly it was for me, that the technical– the technical aspect is probably why you get into a role in data science in the first place, that you just love solving problems, basically, whether that’s with code or with pen and paper. And so that’s, that’s what you want to do. And getting your mind focused elsewhere away from that is probably not viewed as the most fun thing to do, I probably wouldn’t have, when I was starting out in 2014, 2015, I probably wouldn’t have thought it was as fun or as interesting to do that as I do now, maybe. So I think that’s the other reason why it probably doesn’t get as much focus earlier on in my career anyway, at least, as it probably deserved.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
How do you think your– how do you see your role, I guess, evolving over the rest of your career in data science?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I suppose on a personal level, for me it’s, I’m always thinking of what, 10 years down the line, do I still want to be focused just on data science? Or do I want to be focused on a data role, more broadly? I suppose that’s always the main question to ask. And so by that I mean, looking at data engineering as well, data analytics, and being responsible for a wider group. I think the way the field is going anyway, I think a lot more companies seem to move to vertical management rather than horizontal. So by that, I mean having heads of data in different areas of the business. So rather than having a head of data and a head of analytics, you might have a head of data for certain aspects of the business and another head of data then that’s responsible for both in other areas of the business, then. So either way, I think that the broadening of responsibilities and not just being responsible for data science is probably one way I would see my career potentially moving. At the moment, I love just focusing just on the data science, I’m really happy doing that now. But I think that could be one way that my focus changes in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
What personal or professional advice would you give for anyone wanting to be a data scientist?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
Yeah, so first of all, the balance between the soft and hard skills. I think I’ve alluded to it before, but the– don’t put too much– I mean, still emphasise on the technical skills are really important, but don’t feel like it’s the be all end all. I think just understanding the softer side of how you communicate, how you tell a story, for example, and storytelling with data, I think is really important. So I’d say that’s probably one focus area. I think that the second would probably, and maybe it’s a harder one to act on, but being passionate, I think, because whenever I’m looking to recruit anyone new into my team, I think it’s as much about understanding what the potential of that person is as is what is their current performance or where their current capability is – how good they could be in the future is arguably more important. And I think a lot of that comes to ultimately someone’s– whether they have a fixed or growth mindset. So by that, I mean, ultimately, do they want to learn or not, and if they really want to learn, as a lot of data scientists do, but if they have a huge passion for or about data science, and wanting to learn about just how to get better – whether that’s a better coder, better at maths, anything around that – then if you have that attitude, I think then it’s, A, you can have a great impact on our team, but B, I think it’s a sign of someone who can be a great performer in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tarran</strong><br>
So what do you think will be the main challenges facing data science as a field over the next few years?</p>
<p><strong>Niclas Thomas</strong><br>
I think probably, certainly, currently maybe living up to the hype, I suppose. And matching I suppose the classic Gartner Hype Cycle of, it feels like we’re probably at the stage where there’s a lot of– the hype has been around for a few years of data science now and I think making sure we tackle the right problems, I suppose, is one of the – and by ‘we’ I mean, Next as a business or whatever business we’re working in at the time – I think it’s making sure we’re working on the right things. Because I think a lot of people will be keen to have data scientists as part of their work and the product they’re trying to build. What is the best place to spend our time, and what projects we should be working on most I think is– becomes important then because, as I say, there’s a huge demand for data scientists time, I think, in every company. And so choosing where we spend that time wisely, I think, becomes the key challenge and the important decisions for, especially for a head of data science like myself to make then, to make sure we’re best using the team’s capacity, then.</p>

  <title>American Statistical Association joins Real World Data Science as partner</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/10/02/asa-partner.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The first version of Real World Data Science was launched almost one year ago by the <a href="https://rss.org.uk/">Royal Statistical Society</a> (RSS). As we approach our first birthday, we’re delighted to announce that the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/">American Statistical Association</a> (ASA) has become a partner in this project.</p>
<p>ASA shares our goal of developing Real World Data Science as a free and beneficial resource for the entire data science community – one that informs, inspires and strengthens the community by bringing together students, practitioners, leaders, and educators to share knowledge about real-world applications of data science.</p>
<p>The data science profession is geographically and academically diverse. We believe that Real World Data Science can best achieve its goal of being a trusted, go-to resource for all data scientists if a range of partner organisations work together to develop the site and its content, so we’re thrilled that ASA is taking the first step with us towards fulfilling this vision.</p>
<p>Ron Wasserstein, executive director of the American Statistical Association, shared: “We are delighted to be partnering with RSS on Real World Data Science. This is important for our community and serves to further strengthen our valuable relationship with RSS.”</p>
<p>Sarah Cumbers, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society, commented: “We’re thrilled to have ASA on board as a partner for Real World Data Science. We have big plans for the project and this partnership will help us achieve these by allowing us to reach more of the data science community and strengthen our content offering.”</p>
<p>As part of this new partnership with ASA, we will shortly welcome two ASA members to our <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2022/10/18/meet-the-team.html">editorial board</a>. So, on behalf of the entire – and soon-to-be expanded – editorial board, we’d like to say a huge thanks to ASA for their support and endorsement of Real World Data Science.</p>
<p>ASA members, groups, and sections interested in contributing to the site are encouraged to review our <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/contributor-docs/call-for-contributions.html">call for contributions</a> and to <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/contact.html">contact us</a> via email or our social media channels to discuss content ideas.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-data-confusion-to-data-intelligence">From data confusion to data intelligence</h3>
<p>An inspiring start to posit::conf(2023) this morning, with keynote talks from Elaine McVey, senior director of analytics at Chief, and David Meza, head of analytics for human capital at NASA, sharing stories and insights on how to build strong data science foundations in organisations.</p>
<p>McVey spoke about the frequent mismatch between high levels of hope for what data science can achieve within organisations, and low levels of understanding about how to set up data science teams for success. The best chance for success, she said, is if data scientists take the lead in helping organisations learn how to make best use of data science expertise.</p>
<p>From there, McVey went on to present a set of “guerilla data science tactics” that data scientists can use to get around any obstacles they may encounter, as illustrated in the slide below:</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Elaine McVey’s “guerilla data science tactics” for building successful data science teams.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Data scientists should start by scanning for opportunities to help the organisation, before building a small-scale version of what it is they propose to do. Once buy-in is achieved, and data is made available, it’s time to run with the project. Once complete, you need to “nail the landing,” McVey said, and make sure to communicate results broadly – not just to primary stakeholders, but across the organisation. Then comes time to “up the ante”: if your first project has built some organisational goodwill, leverage that and look for something higher risk, with higher potential reward for the organisation.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, McVey said, data scientists should be building foundations for future projects – creating data pipelines, R packages, etc., that can be reused later. This was a point picked up and developed upon by Meza, who walked through in detail the steps required to establish “data foundations” within organisations, drawing on his own past experiences. Typically, he said, organisations seem to collect data just to store it – but always data should be collected, stored, and managed with analysis in mind.</p>

<section id="a-hackers-guide-to-open-source-llms" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-hackers-guide-to-open-source-llms">A hacker’s guide to open source LLMs</h3>
<p>Fast.ai’s Jeremy Howard lifted the hood on large language models (LLMs) in the second of two keynotes this morning.</p>
<p>Beginning with an accessible overview of what LLMs are, how they work, and how they are trained, Howard then addressed some of the criticisms made of LLMs – that they “can’t reason” or give correct answers.</p>
<p>As Howard explained, a model like OpenAI’s GPT-4 is not trained at any point to give correct answers to prompts – only to predict the most likely next word, or word token, in a sequence.</p>
<p>The pre-training step, for example, does not involve only feeding the model with “correct answers,” instead relying on a corpus of text from the internet – some (or, maybe, much) of which may consist of factual inaccuracies, errors, falsehoods, etc. And in the fine-tuning stage, when human feedback is used to either reward or penalise model outputs, Howard said there is a preference for confident-sounding responses – and so, again, this doesn’t necessarily reward the model for giving correct answers.</p>
<p>Howard made the case that users have to help language models to give good answers, and that custom instructions can be used to change the way models respond. He then walked delegates through a series of demos using open-source LLMs, to show how outputs can be refined and improved.</p>
<p>“My view is that if you are going to be good at language modelling in any way,” said Howard, “you have to be good at using language models.”</p>

<section id="documenting-things-openly-for-future-us" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="documenting-things-openly-for-future-us">Documenting Things: Openly for Future Us</h3>
<p>Julia Stewart Lowndes, founding director of <a href="https://openscapes.org/">Openscapes</a>, gave a compelling talk advocating for the importance of documentation for data science projects.</p>
<p>Documenting things, Lowndes said, should be done for the benefit of “Future Us”: not only ourselves but our teams and our communities who may be contributing to or revisiting the project in the next hours, days, weeks, months and years.</p>
<p>Documenting things does not have to be painful, Lowndes said. In fact, it’s supposed to be helpful. It does, however, take time and intention. And it means slowing down briefly to write things down now, in order that work speeds up in the longer term.</p>
<p>Lowndes then shared some pointers to help people get started with documentation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have a place to write things down – Google Docs, GitHub, wherever – ideally a place where people can work collaboratively.
<ol type="i">
<li>Develop the habit of writing things down as you go.</li>
<li>Write in a modular way – small bits of text are less daunting and easier to maintain collaboratively.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Have an audience in mind – you are writing this for someone, so make it engaging for them.
<ol type="i">
<li>write in an inclusive tone.</li>
<li>Narrate code in small chunks, and in a way that you’d say out loud if teaching.</li>
<li>Share, and share early – you want to be able to iterate on your documentation and receive feedback. Also, sharing openly does not always mean publicly – manage permissions as necessary.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Design for readability and accessibility.
<ol type="i">
<li>Use section headers – particularly important for screen readers, but this also helps generally to describe the flow of a document. Plus, you can link readers directly to specific parts of a document.</li>
<li>Use text formatting.</li>
<li>Use alt-text for images, describing the take-home message of the image.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teaching-data-science-in-adverse-circumstances-posit-cloud-and-quarto-to-the-rescue">Teaching Data Science in Adverse Circumstances: Posit Cloud and Quarto to the Rescue</h3>
<p>Professor Aleksander Dietrichson of the Universidad de San Martin brought a valuable perspective to posit::conf(2023) on the challenges of teaching data science in the face of technology and language barriers.</p>
<p>At the public, state-funded university in Argentina where Dietrichson works, more than half of students do not have access to laptops or computers at home, and those who do have access – whether at home or at school – may not have access to the latest kit. But “<a href="https://posit.cloud/">Posit Cloud</a> solves the resource issue,” Dietrichson said. The free-to-use, online browser-based version of Posit’s tools runs on anything; Dietrichson said he’s tested it successfully on both decade-old computers and cellphones – though he doesn’t recommend using it on a cellphone!</p>
<p>On language barriers, he pointed out that learning to code in R and Python can be challenging when English isn’t your first language – if you don’t have semantic access to function names, for example, there will be a steeper learning curve for students.</p>
<p>Dietrichson also has to deal with the problem of “arithmaphobia” among some of the liberal arts students he teaches. This has necessitated a reshuffling of the typical statistics curriculum, he said, in order to make it easier for students to access. But the work is worth it, Dietrichson explained: many of his students want to work in careers like journalism, and he believes that “journalists should be statistically literate.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dynamic-interactions-empowering-educators-and-researchers-with-interactive-quarto-documents-using-webr">Dynamic Interactions: Empowering Educators and Researchers with Interactive Quarto Documents Using webR</h3>
<p>Some of my favourite sessions at posit::conf(2023) were about <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>. Understandable, really, when you consider that we used it to build this very site! Albert Rapp has described Quarto as a <a href="https://albert-rapp.de/posts/16_html_css_for_r/16_html_css_for_r.html">web dev gateway drug</a>, and I’d agree with him:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Quarto is a powerful tool for creating beautiful and interactive documents. I think of it as a gateway drug to web development: While it offers a user-friendly interface for creating documents and blogs, it also allows users to delve into the world of HTML &amp; CSS without even realizing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spoke a bit about my own journey into web dev in one of the Quarto sessions at posit::conf, but what I loved most about these sessions was learning about all the cool new things I’ve yet to discover and try out. For example, <a href="https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/about/">James Balamuta</a>’s talk and demonstration of building interactive code cells into Quarto webpages was an eye-opener!</p>
<p>Since returning from Chicago I’ve tested out this functionality and added Balamuta’s example here. First run the code that’s already in the code block but also edit it to try out your own examples.</p>

<p>Kara Woo, senior data science engineer at InsightRX, began her Wednesday morning keynote with a rousing description of posit::conf(2023) being like a “great community garden” where things are being cultivated and shared for the benefit of all. This is an important feeling, Woo said, because it doesn’t always feel like that in our day jobs. Data scientists can feel siloed, not able to share ideas with like-minded people, and facing resistance from people who say “R can’t do that, R isn’t a real programming language” – a comment that elicited a groan of weary familiarity from sections of the crowd.</p>
<p>But as Woo went on to explain, “it is possible to build quality software in R” and “it is possible to have an organisation where the strengths of R and the people who use it influence the organisation as a whole.”</p>
<p>Woo was speaking from her experience at InsightRX, a precision medicine company, which makes software for clinicians to inform individualised dosing decisions for patients. Through a tool called Nova, clinicians feed in data about a patient’s unique characteristics, which is then passed to R for analysis, which then returns dosage recommendations to Nova.</p>
<p>In InsightRX, R has also been used to solve problems that are not strictly data science problems. Woo gave the example of working with a colleague to write an R package to identify data labels that have been changed and rollout translations for those labels in multiple languages for software users in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>“Our mindset of R being a first-class language empowers us to solve problems,” said Woo.</p>

<p>The second of the morning keynotes on day two of posit::conf(2023) was by JD Long, vice president of risk management at RenaissanceRe.</p>
<p>During Long’s insightful – and frequently very funny – talk, this slide appeared:</p>

<p>Hobbies are important, right? They are a way to relax, to unwind. But also a great opportunity to learn things that might come in handy professionally. At least, that is the experience of Meghan Santiago Harris, a data scientist in the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium at Memorial Sloan Kettering.</p>
<p>Harris shared with delegates her journey into generative art, and how skills acquired using ggplot2 for “fun stuff” had a positive impact on her work.</p>
<p>She first defined generative art as artwork created through a program in any language or interface, so long as the program itself executes the generation of the art. To make generative art, Harris said, you just need data and the ability to “think outside the grid” of your favourite graphics software or package. Harris’s tool of choice is ggplot2, but any will do: “If a tool lets you plot data, it will let you make art,” she said.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">A slide from Meghan Santiago Harris’s talk, with an example of how to create an image of the sun setting on a city using lines of R code.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Harris’s passion for generative art bloomed during a recent period of maternity leave. She was coding for fun but also deepening her understanding and expertise in areas like code iteration, development and communication. And, in August, Harris published an R package called <a href="https://meghansaha.github.io/artpack/">artpack</a>, which is now available on CRAN and designed “to help generative artists of all levels create generative art in R.”</p>
<p>Generative art was a motivation to learn and do more, Harris said, and doing something she loved helped make programming and data science more digestible.</p>

<p>Following straight after Meghan Santiago Harris was Lydia Gibson, a data scientist from Intel, with an inspiring talk about her route into data science. Gibson began by explaining how, when younger, “I wanted to be a fashion designer.” For her high school prom, Gibson even designed her own dress, which her grandmother made for her.</p>
<p>In 2011, Gibson earned a BS in economics and worked in retail customer service and state and local government for a time before deciding to return to school to do a Masters in statistics in 2021. She had “no experience of programming” when she made this decision, but soon learned that R is “a necessary evil if you have to go back to school to do statistics.”</p>
<p>Gibson told delegates that discovering data visualisation was what made her care about R. She could “feed [her] need for creativity” while also learning about things that were required for her course.</p>
<p>And it was the <a href="https://rfordatasci.com/">R for Data Science (R4DS) Online Learning Community</a> that helped take her learning to the next level. Gibson described R4DS as “an amazing, welcoming learning environment where beginners and advanced folks alike can come together to learn not only R but data science as a whole.”</p>
<p>“Being surrounded by folks more advanced than you is a gift, not a curse,” she said, and she urged delegates to find what they are passionate about and explore its depths.</p>

<p>Tom Mock, product manager for Posit Workbench and RStudio, had a full house for his talk about the upcoming integration of <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub’s code Copilot product</a> into RStudio. Copilot, Mock said, is an AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions for code – and this integration is one of the most popular requested features among RStudio users on GitHub.</p>
<p>To make use of the integration, you’ll need a Copilot subscription from GitHub. But more than that, Mock said, users will need to experiment to learn how to get the most out of the “generative [AI] loop.”</p>

  <title>‘What if we try to bring R to the classroom? That was our wacky idea’</title>
  <dc:creator>Brian Tarran</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://rgirls.org.uk/">R-Girls</a> is an exciting new project launched by Green Oak Academy, a faith-based independent secondary school for girls based in Birmingham, England. The project aims to promote the use of R in schools through the development and delivery of R-based lesson plans for a range of subjects.</p>
<p>To find out more about R-Girls, its origins and ambitions, Real World Data Science met with <strong>Mohammed Mohammed</strong>, a governor at Green Oak Academy, principal consultant for the National Health Service (NHS) Midlands and Lancashire Strategy Unit, and a founder of the NHS-R Community.</p>
<section id="what-inspired-r-girls" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-inspired-r-girls">What inspired R-Girls?</h2>
<p>“It was the confluence of a few different things. Firstly, Dr Razia Ghani, head teacher at Green Oak Academy, has a PhD in mathematics from the University of Birmingham, has some experience of doing statistics in the pharmaceutical sector, and teaches mathematics. That meant we had a lot of shared capital in our background and thinking about things.</p>
<p>“When I became a governor of the school, the staff were doing progress reports for pupils, and I wrote a little programme in R to help them with this. So, that was one of the early uses of R in the school.</p>
<p>“I know R because of my experience in academia, and I had previously put in a proposal to the Health Foundation to introduce R to the National Health Service. The Health Foundation agreed to that, they funded it, and we now have an <a href="https://nhsrcommunity.com/">NHS-R Community</a> which is basically promoting the use of R in the health service.</p>
<p>“And so I said to the head teacher, ‘What about if we try to bring R to the classroom?’ That was our wacky idea, and we put in a bid to the <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/">R Consortium</a>, and they gave us seed funding, and that’s how we got started.”</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-aims-of-the-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-aims-of-the-project">What are the aims of the project?</h2>
<p>“The aims of the project are threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote the use of R in secondary schools for girls.</li>
<li>To inspire teachers to incorporate R into their lessons.</li>
<li>To enable students to experience the joy of R.</li>
</ul>
<p>“On our website, we have prepared 10 or so oven-ready lesson plans – they have to be oven-ready for any teacher to ever think about using them; they have to be polished, ready, and easy to use. As well as our website, we have a <a href="https://twitter.com/R_Girls_School">Twitter</a> page and a community on <a href="https://r-girls.slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<p>“One key thing to note is that we didn’t set out to teach programming. The history of computer science in our school is that computer science was really not liked at all by the girls. They wouldn’t choose it as a subject to pursue further. So, we decided to use R to support other subjects. This was a key strategic decision, really.</p>
<p>“People have attempted to develop lesson plans to teach Python, but that would be a non-starter in my school because (a) there isn’t much curriculum space, and (b) no teacher is enthusiastic enough to take on that activity and learn Python and become the Python expert in class. Whereas using R as a tool to facilitate learning in other subjects just opens up the whole world of data science in a way that is so much more accessible and appealing. People may say we’re really not teaching students how to code – but we’re not putting them off coding either!”</p>

<div class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">
<p>The R-Girls website includes <a href="https://rgirls.org.uk/getting_started.html">tutorials on how to get started using R in school</a>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="how-is-r-being-used-in-different-subjects-in-school" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-is-r-being-used-in-different-subjects-in-school">How is R being used in different subjects in school?</h2>
<p>“In maths lessons we do things like generate sequences, plot graphs, do Pythagoras’ Theorem. In geography, we have mapping lessons and lessons on plotting rainfall data from Australian cities.</p>
<p>“Our lesson plans are set up in R Markdown, but the key thing from the teacher’s point of view is that they recognise the structure: What stage is it in terms of the curriculum? What are the objectives, the success criteria and keywords? Typically, we’ll show a worked example and then give the students an exercise to draw a different graph, say – they learn to tweak existing code rather than start from scratch.</p>
<p>“We first taught them how to use R using R Markdown – a way of writing script and code and data all together in one document. And after the first lesson, we were absolutely astonished. This is feedback from one of the girls: ‘Today’s lesson was very interesting and exciting. I’ve learnt a lot of new things about coding and found a new hobby…’ From subsequent lessons, here’s more feedback: ‘Programming and coding was actually quite fun… It was a great feeling knowing that I was able to code a whole bar chart all by myself…’</p>
<p>“A new thing that we’ve done recently is that one of the teachers has been inspired and has learned how to build a website in R, and she’s then decided to teach the Year 9 girls how to build their own websites. One quote from a student was: ‘I learnt how to make a website; I feel like an independent woman now.’ Another said: ‘This was very stressful. But it will look good on my CV.’</p>
<p>“One of the key challenges we face in education is that teachers are very stressed, and Covid didn’t help. Workloads are a massive issue in teaching, and of course that’s the same for our teachers. So, we had to make sure that whatever we do does not feel like it’s adding to the workload. One of the things we do is to use R in the cloud, so there is no installation and debugging on local computers. We try to minimise the pain, really.”</p>

<p>“It would be really nice to see that girls introduced to R through the R-Girls project felt there was a natural progression for them to join the <a href="https://rladies.org/">R-Ladies Group</a>, so that data science becomes part of their future aspirations.</p>
<p>“The second thing is that I’d like to set up an annual conference for girls at school, which would be online and which becomes part of the extracurricular landscape, so that any girl interested in R can join.</p>
<p>“We’d also love to see other schools, especially girls schools, joining the project – and joining the project just means agreeing to take the lessons we have and trying them in class. We would welcome other schools contributing additional lessons to the library of lessons, so that it becomes an open community resource that anybody can use. There’s nothing in this which is designed to make it explicitly local to an English independent school in Birmingham!</p>

  <title>‘Pseudo data science’ and other pitfalls: lessons from the UK’s stats regulator on how not to be misleading</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A typical article on data science hails new data sources, new tools, and new visualisations, and thereby supports the case for the value of data science.</p>
<p>But this article takes a different angle: it talks about potential pitfalls that can face data scientists. It is based on our work as the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), the UK’s regulator for official statistics. We see lots of great work done by statisticians in government. But we also see some of the challenges they face – and data scientists are also likely to encounter the same challenges.</p>
<p>The problems arise from the fact that neither statisticians nor data scientists do their work in isolation. The work usually takes places within organisations – businesses, government bodies, think tanks, academic institutions – and as a result, the statisticians and/or data scientists are not the only players who get to influence how data science is presented and used.</p>
<p>What are the pitfalls we see in our work as regulator?</p>
<section id="pseudo-data-science" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pseudo-data-science">Pseudo data science</h2>
<p>The first type of pitfall is pseudo data science.</p>
<p>Pseudo data science is a term we use to describe attempts to pass off crude work as being more data science-y than it really is. That reflects a sense in public life that data science is new, innovative, somehow the Future. In this context, people who are not data scientists can be tempted to dress themselves up in the clothes of data science to enhance their credibility. This dressing up is usually well-intentioned – communications professionals who want to illuminate and explain complex issues in an engaging way.</p>
<p>The trouble is, it can sometimes backfire. In our work at OSR, we have over the last year seen several examples where organisations have sought to publish visualisations that look like they are the product of in-depth data analysis – when in fact they have been drawn by communications staff using graphic design packages. Examples include <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-david-pares-treasury-inflation-infographic/">inflation</a>, <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/response-from-sir-robert-chote-to-andrew-gwynne-mp-dhsc-chart-on-nurses-pay/">nurses pay</a>, and <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/letter-to-rachel-reeves-mp-gdp-growth-chart/">comparisons of UK economic performance with other countries</a>. To be fair, whenever we have pointed out issues like this, organisations have responded well, putting in place new procedures to ensure that analysts sign off on this kind of visualisations. Nevertheless, we suspect that the temptations to indulge in pseudo data science will remain strong – and we may need to intervene on similar cases in future.</p>
</section>
<section id="unintelligent-transparency" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unintelligent-transparency">Unintelligent transparency</h2>
<p>The second pitfall is a failure of <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/regulatory-guidance-on-intelligent-transparency/">intelligent transparency</a>.</p>
<p>There is a raw form of transparency – quoting a single number (a naked number we call it); or dumping data out into the public domain with no explanation. This is not intelligent transparency. The latter involves being clear where data come from, what their source is, and making underlying data available so that others can understand and verify the statements that are being made. Raw transparency and naked numbers treat an audience with little respect; intelligent transparency helps the audience understand and appreciate what sits behind high level claims.</p>
<p>Data science outputs can sometimes seem to communications teams easy to cherry pick for the most attractive number. Again, like pseudo data science, this reflects largely good intentions – to communicate complex things through ideas. But it becomes easy for a single, unsupported number to be used and reused until it loses most of its meaning. We call this weaponization of data, and it is the antithesis of intelligent transparency. And there is a lot of it about – for example the way in which the former Prime Minister of the UK talked repeatedly about <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/sir-david-norgrove-to-prime-minister-employment-statistics/">employment</a>; or <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/response-from-sir-robert-chote-to-alex-cole-hamilton-msp-scottish-renewable-energy-statistics/">claims</a> about Scotland’s capacity for <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/sir-robert-chote-to-stephen-kerr-msp-renewable-energy/">renewable energy</a>. These examples indicate the pathology of weaponization that can impact data science outputs. They also act as a reminder that data scientists can counter weaponization of their own outputs by delivering engaging and insightful communication.</p>
</section>
<section id="context-collapse" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context-collapse">Context collapse</h2>
<p>The third type of pitfall surrounds context collapse.</p>
<p>This idea comes from the work of the philosopher <a href="http://lucymcdonald.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Context-Collapse-Online-LMcDonald.pdf">Lucy McDonald</a> (who in turn has built on the ideas of <a href="https://www.danah.org/">danah boyd</a>). What is context collapse? Imagine a swimming pool – with neat divisions of the pool into different lanes. All is clearly labelled – fast, medium, slow – for lane swimmers, who are in turn separated from the splash area for families and the deep end for divers. Removing the lanes, and thus taking away any signposting, increases the likelihood for things to go wrong. The fast swimmers doing front crawl clash with the slower breaststroke swimmers; both are constantly having to avoid the families with young children; and all need to watch for the periodic big splashes created by the divers. This is the online communication environment, in which formerly private and casual statements can go viral; in which a brief statement in a media environment can be picked up on and circulated many times; and in which some bad actors (the divers) may wish to disrupt deliberately the debate by breaking all the rules.</p>
<p>How can this affect data science? It happens when individual bits of data are taken from their context, and used in service of a different, and bigger, argument. A good example is data on Covid vaccinations. Here, UK organisations like the Office for National Statistics and the UK Health Security Agency published comprehensive data in good faith about vaccinations and their impact. Some of the underlying data, however, was taken out of the broader context and used in isolation to support criticisms of vaccines – criticisms that the wider evidence base did not support.</p>
<p>The challenge then became how the organisations should respond. At an organisational level, they did not wish to withdraw the data – because that would reduce transparency. Instead they sought to both caveat their data more clearly; and directly rebut the more egregious misuses of the data. In a sense, then, what began as an individual analytical output became part of a broader organisational judgement on positioning in the face of misinformation.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that, against this third pitfall, there is not yet a clear consensus on how to address it. Practice is emerging all the time and we at OSR continue to support producers of data as they grapple with it.</p>
<p>There are other potential pitfalls to using data science. But what unites these three – pseudo data science; unintelligent transparency; and context collapse – is that they relate to situations where data science rubs up against broader organisational dynamics, around communications, presentation and organisational strategy.</p>
<p>And the meta-message is this: for data scientists to thrive in organisations, they need to be good at more than data science. They need to be skilled at working alongside and influencing colleagues from other functions. Only through this form of <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/analytical-leadership/">data leadership</a> can the pitfalls be dealt with effectively.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Thinking of contributing to Real World Data Science but not sure how to get started? Help is at hand, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/finnoh">Finn-Ole Höner</a>. The Amsterdam-based business data science student has created <a href="https://github.com/finnoh/RWDS_post_template">a template repository on GitHub</a> that allows anyone to create Real World Data Science content in our house style and format.</p>
<p>In this repository you’ll find two example Quarto (.qmd) documents, which is the main file type we use for generating site content. The “content-brief.qmd” file is a template for developing article ideas to discuss with our site editors, and the “report.qmd” file is a standard article template. Within that article template you’ll find examples of the range of Quarto features that we use, as well as the code you need to make use of them yourself.</p>
<p>These documents can be edited using tools including Visual Studio Code and R Studio. For details on how to work with Quarto documents, see the <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto website</a>. Once article drafts are finished they can be rendered into HTML format, and the output files will be displayed in the Real World Data Science style, thanks to the inclusion of our stylesheets in the template repository. This is a great way for contributors to see what their content will look like on Real World Data Science before anything is published.</p>
<p>To get started, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/finnoh/RWDS_post_template">RWDS_post_template repository</a> and click the “Use this template” button. Also, be sure to <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/contributor-docs/contributor-guidelines.html">review our contributor guidelines</a> for advice on how to integrate the .qmd templates into the content development and submission workflow.</p>

  <title>For minorities, biased AI algorithms can damage almost every part of life</title>
  <dc:creator>Arshin Adib-Moghaddam</dc:creator>
  <link>https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/posts/2023/09/06/biased-algorithms.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Bad data does not only produce bad outcomes. It can also help to suppress sections of society, for instance vulnerable women and minorities.</p>
<p>This is the argument of <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/is-artificial-intelligence-racist-9781350374423/">my new book</a> on the relationship between various forms of racism and sexism and artificial intelligence (AI). The problem is acute. Algorithms generally need to be exposed to data – often taken from the internet – in order to improve at whatever they do, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/artitifical-intelligence-job-applications-screen-robot-recruiters">screening job applications</a>, or underwriting mortgages.</p>
<p>But the training data often contains many of the biases that exist in the real world. For example, algorithms could learn that most people in a particular job role are male and therefore favour men in job applications. Our data is polluted by a set of myths from the age of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment#:%7E:text=The%20Enlightenment%20included%20a%20range,separation%20of%20church%20and%20state.">“enlightenment”</a>, including biases that lead to <a href="https://www.gaytascience.com/transphobic-algorithms/">discrimination based on gender and sexual identity</a>.</p>
<p>Judging from the history in societies where racism has played a role in <a href="https://sk.sagepub.com/books/racism-from-slavery-to-advanced-capitalism">establishing the social and political order</a>, extending privileges to white males –- in Europe, North America and Australia, for instance –- it is simple science to assume that residues of racist discrimination feed into our technology.</p>
<p>In my research for the book, I have documented some prominent examples. Face recognition software <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/">more commonly misidentified black and Asian minorities</a>, leading to false arrests in the US and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Software used in the criminal justice system has predicted that black offenders would have <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">higher recidivism rates</a> than they did. There have been false healthcare decisions. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342">A study found that</a> of the black and white patients assigned the same health risk score by an algorithm used in US health management, the black patients were often sicker than their white counterparts.</p>
<p>This reduced the number of black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Because less money was spent on black patients who have the same level of need as white ones, the algorithm falsely concluded that black patients were healthier than equally sick white patients. Denial of mortgages for minority populations is facilitated by biased data sets. The list goes on.</p>
<section id="machines-dont-lie" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machines-dont-lie">Machines don’t lie?</h2>
<p>Such oppressive algorithms intrude on almost every <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033390-200-the-essential-guide-to-the-algorithms-that-run-your-life/">area of our lives</a>. AI is making matters worse, as it is sold to us as essentially unbiased. We are told that machines don’t lie. Therefore, the logic goes, no one is to blame.</p>
<p>This pseudo-objectiveness is central to the AI-hype created by the Silicon Valley tech giants. It is easily discernible from the speeches of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, even if now and then they <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">warn us about the projects</a> that they themselves are responsible for.</p>
<p>There are various unaddressed legal and ethical issues at stake. Who is accountable for the mistakes? Could someone claim compensation for an algorithm denying them parole based on their ethnic background in the same way that one might for a toaster that exploded in a kitchen?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://umdearborn.edu/news/ais-mysterious-black-box-problem-explained#:%7E:text=This%20inability%20for%20us%20to,when%20they%20produce%20unwanted%20outcomes.">opaque nature of AI technology</a> poses serious challenges to legal systems which have been built around individual or human accountability. On a more fundamental level, basic human rights are threatened, as legal accountability is blurred by the maze of technology placed between perpetrators and the various forms of discrimination that can be conveniently blamed on the machine.</p>
<p>Racism has always been a systematic strategy to order society. It builds, legitimises and enforces hierarchies between the haves and have nots.</p>
</section>
<section id="ethical-and-legal-vacuum" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethical-and-legal-vacuum">Ethical and legal vacuum</h2>
<p>In such a world, where it’s difficult to disentangle truth and reality from untruth, our privacy needs to be legally protected. The right to privacy and the concomitant ownership of our virtual and real-life data needs to be codified as a human right, not least in order to harvest the real opportunities that good AI harbours for human security.</p>
<p>But as it stands, the innovators are far ahead of us. Technology has outpaced legislation. The ethical and legal vacuum thus created is readily exploited by criminals, as this brave new AI world is largely anarchic.</p>
<p>Blindfolded by the mistakes of the past, we have entered a wild west without any sheriffs to police the violence of the digital world that’s enveloping our everyday lives. The tragedies are already happening on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It is time to counter the ethical, political and social costs with a concerted social movement in support of legislation. The first step is to educate ourselves about what is happening right now, as our lives will never be the same. It is our responsibility to plan the course of action for this new AI future. Only in this way can a good use of AI be codified in local, national and global institutions.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Royal Statistical Society International Conference takes place in Harrogate, England, this September (Monday 4 to Thursday 7). Real World Data Science will be in attendance, and we’ve helped organise a couple of sessions we’d like to tell you about.</p>
<section id="evaluating-ai-how-data-science-and-statistics-can-shape-the-uks-ai-strategy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluating-ai-how-data-science-and-statistics-can-shape-the-uks-ai-strategy">Evaluating AI: How data science and statistics can shape the UK’s AI strategy</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 6 September <strong>Time:</strong> 9:00 am - 10:20 am <strong>Room:</strong> Auditorium (moved from Queens Suite 8)</p>
<p>The launch of ChatGPT less than a year ago is a milestone moment in the story of artificial intelligence. Overnight, large language models were transformed from research projects into consumer products, now used by millions each month. <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/editors-blog/posts/2023/07/19/code-interpreter.html">The capabilities are impressive</a>, <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/careers/posts/2023/05/11/chatgpt-data-science-pt1.html">the productivity gains undeniable</a>. But, what of the downsides? These are issues <a href="https://realworlddatascience.net/viewpoints/interviews/posts/2023/04/28/stephanie-hare.html">societies, governments, and individuals are now starting to reckon with</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2023, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper">the UK government published a white paper promising a “pro-innovation approach” to AI regulation</a>, while also acknowledging the risks AI poses to “people’s privacy, their human rights or their safety” and “concerns about the fairness of using AI tools to make decisions which impact people’s lives”. <a href="https://rss.org.uk/RSS/media/File-library/Policy/2023/RSS-AI-white-paper-response-v2-2.pdf">The Royal Statistical Society, in response, has called for investment in a centre for AI evaluation methodology</a>, arguing that users of AI systems should be able to judge the trustworthiness of claims made by AI companies as well as the outputs of their systems.</p>
<p>What should AI evaluation look like? How will it work in practice? What metrics are most important, and – crucially – who gets to decide this? Join us for <a href="https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/4019/program?session=66677&amp;s=700">a special panel debate at the RSS International Conference</a>, where these questions, and more, will be discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 5 September <strong>Time:</strong> 11:40 am - 1:00 pm <strong>Room:</strong> Auditorium</p>
<p>The Royal Statistical Society (RSS) has published a new guide, “<a href="https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/">Best Practices for Data Visualisation</a>”, containing insights, advice, and examples (with code) to make data outputs more readable, accessible, and impactful. The guide is written primarily for contributors to Royal Statistical Society publications – including <em>Significance</em> magazine, the <em>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A</em>, and Real World Data Science – but the information and advice within is also of broad relevance and use for any data visualisation task.</p>
<p>In the first half of this conference session, authors Andreas Krause, <a href="https://nrennie.rbind.io/">Nicola Rennie</a>, and Brian Tarran will introduce the guide and its key recommendations, and there will be a short demo of how to use the new <a href="https://github.com/nrennie/RSSthemes">{RSSthemes} R package</a>. For the second half of the session, attendees will be invited to share feedback with the authors, propose ideas, and start developing new and expanded sections of the guide. Attendees will be shown how to work with the guide’s source files and collaborate via GitHub, so feel free to bring along a laptop and become a contributor!</p>

<p>The findings and conclusions in this publication are those of the authors and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or US Government determination or policy. This research was supported by the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service and Center for Nutrition, Policy and Promotion. Findings should not be attributed to Circana (formerly IRI).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>About 600,000 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm">deaths per year in the United States</a> are related to chronic diseases that are linked to poor dietary choices. Many other individuals suffer from diet-related health conditions, which may limit their ability to work, learn, and be physically active <span class="citation" data-cites="usda_2020">(US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services 2020)</span>. In recognition of the link between diet and health, in 1974 the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, originally formed to eliminate hunger, expanded its focus to improving eating habits, nutrition policy and the national diet. Since 1980, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been released every five years by the US Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (DHHS). The guidelines present “<a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/">advice on what to eat and drink to meet nutrient needs, promote health, and prevent disease</a>”.</p>
<p>Because there can be economic and social barriers to maintaining a healthy diet, USDA promotes <a href="https://www.usda.gov/nutrition-security">Food and Nutrition Security</a> so that everyone has consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, and affordable foods that promote optimal health and well-being. A set of data tools called the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/purchase-to-plate/">Purchase to Plate Suite</a> (PPS) supports these goals by enabling the update of the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/thriftyfoodplan#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Thrifty%20Food,lowest%20cost%20of%20the%20four.">Thrifty Food Plan</a> (TFP), which estimates how much a budget-conscious family of four needs to spend on groceries to ensure a healthy diet. The TFP market basket – consisting of the specific amounts of various food categories required by the plan – forms the basis of the maximum allotment for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the “Food Stamps” program), which provided financial support towards the cost of groceries for <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap">over 41 million individuals in almost 22 million households in fiscal year 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The 2018 Farm Act (Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018) requires that USDA reevaluate the TFP every five years using current food composition, consumption patterns, dietary guidance, and food prices, and using approved scientific methods. USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) was charged with estimating the current food prices using retail food scanner data <span class="citation" data-cites="levin_et_al_2018 muth_et_al_2016">(Levin et al. 2018; Muth et al. 2016)</span> and utilized the PPS for this task. The most recent TFP update was released in August 2021 and the revised cost of the market basket was the first non-inflation adjustment increase in benefits for SNAP in over 40 years <span class="citation" data-cites="thrifty_food_plan_2021">(US Department of Agriculture 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>The PPS combines datasets to enhance research related to the economics of food and nutrition. There are four primary components of the suite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase to Plate Crosswalk (PPC),</li>
<li>Purchase to Plate Price Tool (PPPT),</li>
<li>Purchase to Plate National Average Prices (PP-NAP) for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and</li>
<li>Purchase to Plate Ingredient Tool (PPIT).</li>
</ul>
<p>The PPC allows researchers to measure the healthfulness of store purchases. On average <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/foodaps-national-household-food-acquisition-and-purchase-survey/summary-findings/#calories">US consumers acquire about 75% of their calories from retail stores</a>, and there are a number of studies linking the availability of foods at home to the healthfulness of the overall diet <span class="citation" data-cites="gattshall_et_al_2008 hanson_et_al_2005">(e.g., Gattshall et al. 2008; Hanson et al. 2005)</span>. Thus, understanding the healthfulness of store purchases allows us to understand differences in consumers who purchase healthy versus less healthy foods, and may contribute to better policies that promote healthier food purchases. While healthier diets are linked to a lower risk of disease outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="REEDY2014881">(Reedy et al. 2014)</span>, other factors such as health care access may also be contributors <span class="citation" data-cites="cleary_et_al_2022">(Cleary, Liu, and Carlson 2022)</span>. The PPC also forms the basis of the price tool, PPPT – which allows researchers to estimate custom prices for dietary recall studies – and a new ERS data product, the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/purchase-to-plate/">PP-NAP</a>. The national average prices from PP-NAP are used in reevaluating the TFP. By using the PP-NAP with 24-hour dietary recall information from surveys such as What We Eat in America (<a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/wweianhanes-overview/">WWEIA</a>) – the dietary component of the nationally representative <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a>(NHANES)<sup>1</sup> – researchers can examine the relationship between the cost of food, dietary intake, and chronic diseases linked to poor diets. The price estimates also allow researchers to develop cost-effective healthy diets such as <a href="https://www.myplate.gov/myplate-kitchen/recipes">MyPlate Kitchen</a>. The final component of the Purchase to Plate Suite, the ingredient tool (PPIT), breaks dietary recall-reported foods back into purchasable ingredients, based on US retail food purchases. The PPIT is also used in the revaluation of the TFP, and by researchers who want to look at the relationship between reported ingestion of grocery items, cost and disease outcomes using WWEIA/NHANES. More information on the development of the PPC is available in two papers by Carlson et al. <span class="citation" data-cites="carlson_et_al_2019 carlson_et_al_2022">(2019, 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>The Food for Thought competition aimed to support the development of the PPC – and thus policy-oriented research – by linking retail food scanner data to the USDA nutrition data used to analyze NHANES dietary recall data, specifically the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) <span class="citation" data-cites="fndds_2018 fndds_2020">(2018, 2020)</span>. In particular, the competition set out to use artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce human resources in creating the links for the PPC, while still maintaining the high-quality standards required for reevaluating the TFP and for data published by ERS (which is one of 13 Principle Statistical Agencies in the United States Federal Government).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-used-to-date">Methods used to date</h2>
<p>On the surface, the linking process may appear simple: both the FNDDS and retail food scanner data are databases of food. But the scanner data are produced for market research, and the FNDDS for dietary studies. The scanner data include about 350,000 items with sales each year, while the FNDDS has only 10,000–15,000 items. Scanner data relates to specific products, while FNDDS items are often more general. Both datasets have different hierarchical structures – the FNDDS hierarchy is based around major food groups: dairy; meat, poultry and seafood; eggs; nuts and legumes; grains; fruits; vegetables; fats and oils; and sugars, sweets, and beverages. Items fall into the groups regardless of preparation method or form. That is, broccoli prepared from frozen and from fresh both appear in the vegetable group, and for some fruits and vegetables, the fresh, frozen, canned and dried form are the same FNDDS item. Vegetable-based mixed dishes, such as broccoli and carrot stir-fry or soup, are also classified in the vegetable group. On the other hand, the scanner data classifies foods by grocery aisle. That is, the fresh and frozen broccoli are classified in different areas: produce and frozen vegetables. Similarly, when sold as a prepared food, the broccoli and carrot stir-fry may be found in the frozen entries, as a kit in either the frozen or produce section, refrigerated foods, or all of these.</p>
<p>To allow researchers to import the FNDDS nutrient data into the scanner data, a one-to-many match between FNDDS and scanner data items was needed. The food descriptions in the scanner data include brand names and package sizes and are written as a consumer would pronounce them – e.g., fresh and crisp broccoli florets, ready-cut, 10 oz – versus a more general FNDDS description such as “Broccoli, raw”. (Also linked to the “Broccoli, raw” code would be broccoli sold with stems attached, broccoli spears, and any other way raw broccoli is sold.) In the scanner data, the Universal Product Code (UPC) and the European Article Number (EAN) can link items between tables within the scanner data, as well as between datasets of grocery items, such as the USDA Global Branded Foods Product Database, a component of <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html">USDA’s Food Data Central</a>. However, these codes are not related to the FNDDS codes, or any other column within the FNDDS. In other words, before development of the PPC, there were no established linking identifiers.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the process USDA uses to develop matches between scanner data and FNDDS.</p>

</div>
<p>We start the linking process by categorizing the scanner data items into homogeneous groups to make the first round of automated matching more efficient. To save time, we use the second lowest hierarchical category in the scanner data which generally divides items within a grocery aisle into homogenous groups such as produce, canned beans, baking mixes, and bread. Once the linking categories for scanner data are established, we select appropriate items from the FNDDS. Since the FNDDS is highly structured, this selection is usually straightforward.</p>
<p>Our next step is to use semantic matching to create a search table that aligns similar terms within the IRI product dictionary and FNDDS. This first requires that we extract attributes from the FNDDS descriptions into fields similar to those in the scanner data product dictionary. The FNDDS descriptions are found across multiple columns because they are added as the need arises to provide examples of brand names or alternative descriptions of foods which help code the foods WWEIA participants report eating. We manually create matching tables that link terms used in FNDDS to those used in the scanner data, organized by the fields defined in the restructured FNDDS. We then use this table as the basis of a probabilistic matching process. For example, when linking the produce group, “fresh” in the scanner data would be aligned with “raw” and “prepared from fresh” and NOT “prepared from frozen” in the FNDDS, and “broccoli florets” would also be aligned with “raw” and “broccoli”. Since the FNDDS is designed to code the foods individuals report eating, many of the foods in the FNDDS are already prepared and result in descriptions such as “broccoli, steamed, prepared from fresh” or “broccoli, boiled, prepared from frozen”.</p>
<p>Once the linking table is established, the probabilistic match process returns the single best possible match for each item in the scanner data. For example, a match between fresh broccoli florets and frozen broccoli would have a lower probability score than “broccoli, raw”. Because these matches form the basis of major USDA policies, we cannot accept an error rate of more than 5 percent, and lower is preferred. To reach that goal, nutritionists review every match to make sure the probabilistic match did not return a match between cauliflower florets and fresh broccoli, say, or that a broccoli and carrot stir-fry is not matched to a dish with broccoli, carrots, and chicken. The correct matches, such as the one between fresh broccoli florets and raw broccoli, are set aside while the items with an incorrect match, such as cauliflower florets and the broccoli and carrot stir-fry, are used to revise the search table. Revisions might include adding (NOT chicken) to the broccoli and carrot stir-fry dish. Mixed dishes — such as the broccoli and carrot stir-fry — pose particular challenges because there are a wide variety of similar products available in the grocery store. After a few rounds of revising the search table and running the probabilistic match process, it is more efficient to use a manual match, established by one nutritionist and reviewed by another, after which the match is assumed to be correct.</p>
<p>The process improved with each new wave of FNDDS and IRI data. Our first creation of the PPC linked the FNDDS 2011/12 to the 2013 IRI retail scanner data. Subsequent waves started with the previous search table and resulting matches were reviewed by nutritionists. We also used more fields in the IRI product dictionary to create the homogeneous linking groups and made modifications to these groups with each wave. During each wave we experimented with the number of rounds of probabilistic matching that was the most cost effective. For some linking groups it took less human time to manually match from the start, while for other groups it was more efficient to do multiple rounds of improvements to the search table. Starting with the most recent wave (matching FNDDS 2017/18 to the 2017 and 2018 retail scanner data), we assumed previous matches appearing in the newer data were correct. Although this assumption was good for most matches, a review demonstrated the need to review previous matches prior to removing the item from the list of scanner data items needing FNDDS matches. In the future we intend to explore methods developed by the participants of the Food for Thought competition.</p>
</section>
<section id="linking-challenges" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linking-challenges">Linking challenges</h2>
<p>An ongoing challenge to the linking problem is that both the scanner data and the FNDDS undergo substantive changes each year, meaning that both the previous matches and search tables need to be reviewed and revised with each new effort, as tables that work with one cycle of FNDDS and scanner data will need revisions to use with the next cycle. Changes to the scanner data that impact our current method include dropped and added items, data corrections, and revisions to the categories that form the basis of the homogeneous linking groups. In addition, there are errors such as incorrect food descriptions, conflicting package size information, and changes in the item description from year to year. Since the FNDDS is designed to support dietary recall studies, revisions reflect both changes to available foods and the level of detail respondents can provide. These revisions result in dropped/added food codes, changes to food descriptions that impact which scanner data items match to the FNDDS items, and revisions to recipes used in the nutrient coding which impacts the number of retail ingredients available in the FNDDS.</p>
<p>Of the four parts of the PPS, establishing the matches is the most time-consuming task and constitutes at least 60 percent of the total budget. In the most recent round, we had 168 categories and each one went through 2-3 automated matching rounds; after each round, nutritionists spent an average of two hours reviewing the matches. This adds up to somewhere between 670 and 1,000 hours of review time. After the automated review, manual matching requires an additional 300 hours. Reducing the amount of time required to establish matches and link the FNDDS and retail scanner datasets may lead to significant time savings, resulting in faster data availability. That, in turn, could allow more timely policy-based research, and the mandated revision of the Thrifty Food Plan can continue with the most recent food price data.</p>

  <title>The Food for Thought Challenge: Using AI to support evidence-based food and nutrition policy</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>There’s a saying: “You are what you eat.” Its meaning is somewhat open to interpretation, as with many such sayings, but it is typically used to make the point that if you want to <em>be</em> well, you need to eat well. Nutrition scientists and dieticians spend their careers trying to figure out what “eating well” looks like – the foods the human body needs, in what quantities, and how best to consume them. Their research informs advice and guidance issued by health professionals and governments. Ultimately, though, the choice of what to eat falls to us – individuals and families – and our choices are often determined by our tastes, the availability of foodstuffs in our local stores, their price and affordability.</p>
<p>So, what exactly <em>do</em> we eat? Answers come from a variety of sources. In the United States, there are dietary recall studies such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a>, which asks a sample of respondents to report their food and beverage consumption over a set period of time. There are also organisations like <a href="https://www.iriworldwide.com/en-gb">IRI</a> that collect point-of-sale data from retail stores on the actual food and drink being sold to consumers. By and large, this information comes from barcodes on product packaging being scanned at checkouts, so it is often referred to as “scanner data”.</p>
<p>This data – from dietary recall studies and retail scanners – is valuable: once we know what people are eating, we can check the nutritional content of those foods and build up a picture of what the diet of a typical individual or family looks like and how it compares to the diet recommended by doctors and policymakers. And, if we know what other foodstuffs are available, how much they cost, and the nutritional value of those items, we can work out how much families need to spend, and on what, in order to eat well and, hopefully, be well.</p>
<p>Figuring all this out is where something called the Purchase to Plate Crosswalk (PPC) comes in. It’s a key tool for understanding the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157521005445">healthfulness of retail food purchases</a>” and it does this by linking IRI scanner data on what people buy with data on the nutritional content of those foods, as recorded in the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). But there’s a catch: scanner data is collected about hundreds of thousands of food products, whereas the FNDDS has nutritional profile information for only a few thousand items. Linking these two datasets therefore gives rise to a one-to-many matching problem – a problem that takes several hundred person-hours to resolve.</p>
<p>What if machine learning can help? That question inspired a competition, the Food for Thought Challenge, organized by the Coleridge Initiative, a nonprofit organization working with governments to ensure that data are more effectively used for public decision-making. Researchers and data scientists were invited to use machine learning and natural language processing to more efficiently link data on supermarket products to nutrient databases.</p>
<p>This collection of articles tells the story of the <a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/projects/food-for-thought">Food for Thought Challenge</a>. We begin by exploring the <a href="../../../../../case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/01-purchase-to-plate.html">policy issues</a> that drive the development of the PPC – the need to understand the national diet, developing healthy diet plans, and costing up those plans – and the issues posed by record linkage.

<p>Undergraduate student Yifan (Rosetta) Hu was responsible for writing the Python script that pre-processes the 2015–2016 UPC, EC, and PPC data for training neural network models. Her script randomly sampled five negative EC descriptions for every positive match between a UPC and EC code. Professor Mandy Korpusik performed the remaining work, including setting up the environment, training the BERT model, and evaluation. Hu spent roughly 10 hours on the competition, and Korpusik spent roughly 40 hours of work (and many additional hours running and monitoring the training and testing scripts).</p>
<section id="our-perspective-on-the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-perspective-on-the-challenge">Our perspective on the challenge</h2>
<p>The goal of this challenge is to use machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to link language-based entries in the IRI and FNDDS databases. Our proposed approach is based on our prior work using deep learning models to map users’ natural language meal descriptions to the FNDDS database <span class="citation" data-cites="7953245">(Korpusik, Collins, and Glass 2017b)</span> to retrieve nutrition information in a spoken diet tracking system. In the past, we found a trade-off between accuracy and cost, leading us to select convolutional neural networks over recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) networks – with nearly 10x as many parameters and 2x the training time required, LSTMs achieved slightly lower performance on semantic tagging and food database mapping on meals in the breakfast category. Here, we propose to investigate state-of-the-art transformers, specifically the contextual embedding model (i.e., the entire sentence is used as context to generate the embedding) known as BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, Devlin et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<section id="related-work" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="related-work">Related work</h5>
<p>Within the past few years, several papers have come out that learn contextual representations of sentences, where the entire sentence is used to generate embeddings.</p>
<p>ELMo <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1802-05365">(Peters et al. 2018)</span> uses a linear combination of vectors extracted from intermediate layer representations of a bidirectional LSTM trained on a large text corpus as a language model; in this feature-based approach, the ELMo vector of the full input sentence is concatenated with the standard context-independent token representations and passed through a task-dependent model for final prediction. This showed performance improvement over state-of-the-art on six NLP tasks, including question answering, textual entailment, and sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>OpenAI GPT <span class="citation" data-cites="radford2018improving">(Radford et al. 2018)</span> is a fine-tuning approach, where they first pre-train a multi-layer transformer <span class="citation" data-cites="NIPS2017_3f5ee243">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</span> as a language model on a large text corpus, and then conduct supervised fine-tuning on the specific task of interest, with a linear softmax layer on top of the pre-trained transformer.</p>
<p>Google’s BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(2018)</span> is a fine-tuning approach similar to GPT, but with the key difference that instead of combining separately trained forward and backward transformers, they instead use a masked language model for pre-training, where they randomly masked out input tokens and predicted only those tokens. They demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on 11 NLP tasks, including the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition task, which is similar to our semantic tagging task.</p>
<p>Finally, many models have recently been developed that improve upon BERT, including RoBERTa <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-11692">(which improves BERT’s pre-training by using bigger batches and more data, Y. Liu et al. 2019)</span>, XLNet <span class="citation" data-cites="NEURIPS2019_dc6a7e65">(which uses Transformer-XL and avoids BERT’s pretrain-finetune discrepancy through learning a truly bidirectional context via permutations over the factorization order, Yang et al. 2019)</span>, and ALBERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1909-11942">(a lightweight BERT, Lan et al. 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>In our prior work on language understanding for nutrition <span class="citation" data-cites="7078635 7472843 7902155 korpusik17_interspeech 8461769 8721137">(Korpusik et al. 2014, 2016; Korpusik and Glass 2017, 2018, 2019; Korpusik, Collins, and Glass 2017a)</span>, we used a similar binary classification approach for learning embeddings, which were then used at test time to map from user-described meals to USDA food database matches, but with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) instead of BERT. (BERT was not created until 2018, and due to limited memory available for deployment, we needed a smaller model than even BERT base, which has 100 million parameters.) Further work demonstrated that BERT outperformed CNNs on several language understanding tasks, including nutrition <span class="citation" data-cites="korpusik19_interspeech">(Korpusik, Liu, and Glass 2019)</span>.</p>

<section id="our-approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<p>Our approach is to fine-tune a large pre-trained BERT language model on the food data. BERT was originally trained on a massive amount of text for a language modelling task (i.e., predicting which word should come next in a sentence). It relies on a transformer model, which uses an “attention” mechanism to identify which words the model should pay the most “attention” to. We are specifically using BERT for binary sequence classification, which refers to predicting a label (i.e., classification) for a sequence of words. In our case, during fine-tuning (i.e., training the model further on our own dataset) we will feed the model pairs of sentences (where one sentence is the UPC description of a food item and the other is the EC description of another food item), and the model will perform binary classification, predicting whether the sentences are a match (i.e., 1) or not (i.e., 0). We start with the 2015–2016 ground truth PPC data for positive examples, and five randomly sampled negative examples per positive example.</p>
<section id="training-methods" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-methods">Training methods</h5>
<p>Since we used a neural network model, the only features passed into our model were the tokenized words themselves of the EC and UPC food descriptions – we did not conduct any manual feature engineering <span class="citation" data-cites="dong_liu">(Dong and Liu 2018)</span>. The model was trained on a 90/10 split into 90% training and 10% validation data, where the validation data was used as a test set to fine-tune the model’s hyperparameters. We started with a randomly sampled set of 16,000 pairs, batch size of 16 (i.e., the model would train on batches of 16 samples at a time), AdamW <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1711-05101">(Loshchilov and Hutter 2017)</span> as the optimizer (which adaptively updates the learning rate, or how large the update should be to the model’s parameters), a linear schedule with warmup <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1908-03265">(i.e., starting with a small learning rate in the first few epochs of training due to large variance in early stages of training, L. Liu et al. 2019)</span>, and one epoch (i.e., the number of times the model passes through all the training data). We then added the next randomly sampled set of 16,000 pairs to get a model trained on 32,000 data points. Finally, we reached a total of 48,000 data samples used for training. Each pair of sequences was tokenized with the pre-trained BERT tokenizer, with the special CLS and SEP tokens (where CLS is a learned vector that is typically passed to downstream layers for final classification, and SEP is a learned vector that separates two input sequences), and was padded with zeros to the maximum length input sequence of 240 tokens, so that each input sequence would be the same length.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-development-approach" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-development-approach">Model development approach</h5>
<p>We faced many challenges due to the secure nature of the ADRF environment. Since our approach relies on BERT, we were blocked by errors due to the local BERT installation. Typically, BERT is downloaded from the web as the program runs. However, for this challenge, BERT must be installed locally for security reasons. To fix the errors, the BERT models needed to be installed with <code>git lfs clone</code> instead of git.</p>
<p>Second, we were unable to retrieve the test data from the database due to SQLAlchemy errors. We found a workaround by using DBeaver directly to save database tables as Excel spreadsheets, rather than accessing the database tables through Python.</p>
<p>Finally, we needed a GPU in order to efficiently train our BERT models. However, we initially only had a CPU, so there was a delay due to setting up the GPU configuration. Once the GPU image was set up, there was still a CUDA error when running the BERT model during training. We determined that the model was too big to fit into GPU memory, so we found a workaround using gradient checkpointing (trading off computation speed for memory) with the transformers library’s Trainer and TrainingArguments. Unfortunately, the version of transformers we were using did not have these tools, and the library was not updated until less than a week before the deadline, so we still had to train the model on the CPU.</p>
<p>To deal with the inability to run jobs in the background, our process was checkpointing our models every five batches, and saving the model predictions during evaluation to a csv file every five batches as well.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-results">Our results</h2>
<p>After training, the 48K model (so-called because it was trained on 48,000 data samples) was used at test time via ranking all possible 2017–18 EC descriptions given an unseen UPC description. The rankings were obtained through the model’s output value – the higher the output (or confidence), the more highly we ranked that EC description. To speed up the ranking process, we used blocking (i.e., only ranking a subset of all possible matches), specifically with exact word matches (using only the first six words in the UPC description, which appeared to be the most important), and fed all possible matches through the model in one batch per UPC description. Since we still did not have sufficient time to complete evaluation on the full set of test UPC descriptions, we implemented an expedited evaluation that only considered the first 10 matching EC descriptions in the BERT ranking process (which we call BERT-FAST). We also report results for the slower evaluation method that considers all EC descriptions that match at least one of the first six words in a given UPC description, but note that these results are based on just a small subset of the total test set. See Table 1 below for our results, where the <span class="citation" data-cites="5">(<strong>5?</strong>)</span> indicates how often the correct match was ranked among the top-5. See Table 2 for an estimate of how long it takes to train and test the model on a CPU.<br>

<p>In the future, with more time available, we would train on all data, not just our limited dataset of 48,000 pairs, as well as perform evaluation on the held-out test set with the full set of possible EC matches that have one or more words in common with the UPC description. We would compare against baseline word embedding methods such as word2vec <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-09405">(Mikolov et al. 2017)</span> and Glove <span class="citation" data-cites="pennington-etal-2014-glove">(Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014)</span>, and we would explore hierarchical prediction methods for improving efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we would first train a classifier to predict the generic food category, and then train finer-grained models to predict specific foods within a general food category. Finally, we are exploring multi-modal transformer-based approaches that allow two input modalities (i.e., food images and text descriptions of a meal) for predicting the best UPC match.</p>

<p>We recommend that future challenges provide every team with both a CPU and a GPU in their workspace, to avoid transitioning from one to the other midway through the challenge. In addition, if possible, it would be very helpful to provide a mechanism for running jobs in the background. Finally, it may be useful for teams to submit snippets of code along with library package names, in order for the installations to be tested properly beforehand.</p>

<p>Text matching is an essential task in natural language processing <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/PangLGXWC16">(NLP, Pang et al. 2016)</span>, while record linkage across different sources is an essential task in data science. Machine learning techniques allow people to combine data faster and cheaper than using manual linkage. However, in the context of the Food for Thought challenge, existing methods for matching universal product codes (UPCs) to ensemble codes (ECs) require every UPC to be compared with every EC code (Figure 1a). Such approaches can be computationally expensive in the training process when data is noisy. Here, we propose an ensemble model with a category-based adapter to tackle this problem, drawing on the category information included in UPC and EC data. The category-based adapter allows UPCs to be first matched with only a small and reliable set of ECs (Figure 1b). Then, an ensemble model will be deployed to make predictions for UPC-EC matching. Our proposed approach can achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art models.</p>

<section id="our-approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<p>We propose a two-step framework to address this problem. To begin with, we use a category-based adapter to get reliable candidate ECs for each UPC. Then, an ensemble model <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1007/3-540-45014-9_1">(Dietterich 2000)</span> is deployed to make a prediction for each UPC-EC pair.</p>
<section id="category-based-adapter" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="category-based-adapter">Category-based adapter</h5>
<p>By using 2015–2016 UPC-EC data, we created a knowledge base, which is a UPC category–EC pair-wised table for generating candidate ECs. Within this setting, each UPC category is, on average, related to only 32 ECs. This knowledge base is then used as context to further filter the candidate ECs. Note that there are some new ECs generated year by year, which can also be part of the potential ECs in the UPC-EC matching task, since the contextual information of new ECs does not exist in our knowledge base.</p>

<section id="ensembled-model" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ensembled-model">Ensembled model</h5>
<p>We ensemble the base-string match and BERT models. BERT is a deep learning model for natural language processing <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(Devlin et al. 2018)</span>. In the base-string match model, we used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) of each UPC and EC description as features to calculate a pairwise cosine similarity, which is a distance between instances. Meanwhile, we used features extracted from UPC and EC descriptions to fine-tune the BERT base model and calculated the cosine similarity of embeddings between each UPC and EC. Then we rank ECs based on their similarity scores with the UPC.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-results">Our results</h2>
<p>We randomly selected 500 samples from the 2017–2018 UPC-EC data to train the ensembled weight for each model. Two functions were adapted to make a fusion of base-string and BERT models:</p>
<p><span id="eq-first"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC%20=%20a%20*%20X%20+%20b%20*%20Y%20%20%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p><span id="eq-second"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AC%20=%20%20a%20*%20log(X)%20+%20b%20*%20log(Y)%20%5Ctext%7B.%20%7D%0A%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> denotes the final confidence score. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Y"> represent <em>base_string_similarity_score</em> and <em>BERT_similarity_score</em>, respectively. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b"> are corresponding model weights for base_string and BERT models.</p>
<p>A better Success@5 is achieved with function (1). The ensembled weights for the base-string model and BERT model are 0.738 and 0.262, respectively. The experiment result indicates that the base_string model contributes more than the BERT model when the ensemble model makes predictions. The prediction result for the 2017–2018 data is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Success@5: 0.727</li>
<li>NDCG@5: 0.528</li>
</ul>
<p>Computation time is 6 hours.</p>

<section id="future-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>Our next step will focus on adding the newly generated EC data into our knowledge base, which allows the model to be more stable to make predictions for UPC-EC matching. Our model is an unsupervised method, which does not need labels for each instance. We use cosine similarity to rank the matches, so no labels are needed in the training process. However, our future work will try to label some instances to handle the UPC-EC matching task in a supervised manner.</p>

<section id="lessons-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>If the data is not complex, simple models may outperform complex models.</strong> For example, in our experiment, we found that the base-string model outperforms single RoBERTa <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-11692">(Liu et al. 2019)</span> or BERT models. However, our ensemble model can outperform each individual model since model fusion allows information aggregation from multiple models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-label models may not work well on UPC-EC data.</strong> In our early work, we tried to consider the UPC-EC matching task as a multi-label problem, e.g., we labeled each EC as a binary label which indicated whether the EC was an appropriate match or not. We mapped UPC and EC pairs into a multi-label table. However, we find that the UPC and EC keeps a one-to-one relation for most UPCs. The model performance of a multi-label model, i.e., Label-Specific Attention Network <span class="citation" data-cites="xiao-etal-2019-label">(LSAN, Xiao et al. 2019)</span>, is lower than base-string model on both Success@5 and NDCG@5 metrics.</p></li>

  <title>Food for Thought: The value of competitions for confidential data</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We are witnessing a sea change in data collection practices by both governments and businesses – from purposeful collection (through surveys and censuses, for example) to opportunistic (drawing on web and social media data, and administrative datasets). This shift has made clear the importance of record linkage – a government might, for example, look to link records held by its various departments to understand how citizens make use of the gamut of public services.</p>
<p>However, creating manual linkages between datasets can be prohibitively expensive, time consuming, and subject to human constraints and bias. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer the potential to combine data better, faster, and more cheaply. But, as the recently released <a href="https://www.ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NAIRR-TF-Final-Report-2023.pdf">National AI Research Resources Task Force report</a> highlights, it is important to have an open and transparent approach to ensure that unintended biases do not occur.</p>
<p>In other words, ML tools are not a substitute for thoughtful analysis. Both private and public producers of a linked dataset have to determine the level of linkage quality – such as what precision/recall tradeoff is best for the intended purpose (that is, the balance between false-positive links and failure to cover links that should be there), how much processing time and cost is acceptable, and how to address coverage issues. The challenge is made more difficult by the idiosyncrasies of heterogeneous datasets, and more difficult yet when datasets to be linked include confidential data <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1257/jel.20171350 DBLP:books/sp/ChristenRS20">(Christensen and Miguel 2018; Christen, Ranbaduge, and Schnell 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>And, of course, an ML solution is never the end of the road: many data linkage scenarios are highly dynamic, involving use cases, datasets, and technical ecosystems that change and evolve over time; effective use of ML in practice necessitates an ongoing and continuous investment <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2112-01716">(Koch et al. 2021)</span>. Because techniques are constantly improving, producers need to keep abreast of new approaches. A model that is working well today may no longer work in a year because of changes in the data, or because the organizational needs have changed so that a certain type of error is no longer acceptable. As Sculley et al.&nbsp;point out, “it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning” <span class="citation" data-cites="43146">(Sculley et al. 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Also important is that record linkage is not seen as a technical problem relegated to the realm of computer scientists to solve. The full engagement of domain experts in designing the optimization problem, identifying measures of success, and evaluating the quality of the results is absolutely critical, as is building an understanding of the pros and cons of different measures <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1371/journal.pone.0249833 10.1007/s11222-017-9746-6">(Schafer et al. 2021; Hand and Christen 2018)</span>. There will need to be much learning by doing in “sandbox” environments, and back and forth communication across communities to achieve successful outcomes, as noted in the <a href="https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2022-10/acdeb-year-2-report.pdf">recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building</a> (a screenshot of which is shown in Figure 1).</p>

<div class="figure-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A recommendation for building an “innovation sandbox” as part of the creation of a new National Secure Data Service in the United States.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite the importance of trial and error and transparency about linkage quality, there is no handbook that guides domain experts in how to design such sandboxes. There is a very real need for agreed-upon, domain-independent guidelines, or better yet, official standards to evaluate sandboxes. Those standards would define “who” could and would conduct the evaluation, and help guarantee independence and repeatability. And while innovation challenges have been embraced by the federal government, the devil can be very much in the details <span class="citation" data-cites="4138bca6-f7b7-3af8-a96c-5e2544823c5c">(Williams 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the approach taken in the Food for Thought linkage competition, and described in this compendium, provides an important first step towards a well specified, replicable framework for achieving high quality outcomes. In that respect it joins other recent efforts to bring together community-level research on shared sensitive data <span class="citation" data-cites="macavaney-etal-2021-community tsakalidis-etal-2022-overview">(MacAvaney et al. 2021; Tsakalidis et al. 2022)</span>. This competition, like those, helped bring to the foreground both the opportunities and challenges of doing research in secure sandboxes with sensitive data. Notably, these exercises highlight a kind of cultural tension between secure, managed environments, on the one hand, and unfettered machine learning research, on the other. The need for flexibility and agility in computational research bumps up against the need for advance planning and careful step-by-step processes in environments with well-defined data governance rules, and one of the key lessons learned is that the tradeoffs here need to be recognized and planned for.</p>
<p>This particular competition was important for a number of other reasons. Thanks to its organization as a competition, complete with prizes and bragging rights for strongly performing teams, it attracted new eyes from computer science and data science to think about how to address a critical real-world linkage problem. It offered the potential to produce approaches that were scalable, transparent, and reproducible. The engagement of domain experts and statisticians meant that it will be possible to conduct an informed error analysis, to explicitly relate the performance metrics in the task to the problem being solved in the real world, and to bring in the expertise of survey methodologists to think about the possible adjustments. And because it identified different approaches of addressing the same problem, it created an environment for new innovative ideas.</p>
<p>More generally, in addition to the excitement of the new approaches, this exercise laid bare the fragility of linkages in general and highlighted the importance of secure sandboxes for confidential data. While the promise of privacy preserving technologies is alluring as <a href="https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2022-10/acdeb-year-2-report.pdf">an alternative to bringing confidential data together in one place</a>, such approaches are likely too immature to deploy ad hoc until a better understanding is established of how to translate real-world problems and their associated data into well-defined tasks, how to measure quality, and particularly how to assess the impact of match quality on different subgroups <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1145/3433638">(Domingo-Ferrer, Sánchez, and Blanco-Justicia 2021)</span>. The scientific profession has gone through too painful a lesson with the premature application of differential privacy techniques to ignore the lessons that can be learned from a careful and systematic analysis of different approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1145/3433638 van_riper 10.1257/pandp.20191107 giles2022faking">(2021; Van Riper et al. 2020; Ruggles et al. 2019; Giles et al. 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>We hope that the articles in this collection provide not only the first steps towards a handbook of best practices, but also an inspiration to share lessons learned, so that success can be emulated, and failures understood and avoided.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Since 2014, the professional services firm Westat, Inc.&nbsp;has been developing the Purchase to Plate Crosswalk (PPC) for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS). The PPC links the retail food transactions database from IRI’s InfoScan service and the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). However, the current linkage process uses only partly automated data matching, meaning it is resource intensive, time consuming, and requires manual review.</p>
<p>With sponsorship from ERS, Westat partnered with the Coleridge Initiative to host the Food for Thought competition to challenge researchers and data scientists to use machine learning and natural language processing to find accurate and efficient methods for creating the PPC. Figure 1 provides a visual overview of the challenge set by the competition.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="images/pt2-fig1.png"><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/images/pt2-fig1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="700"></a></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Overview of the Food for Thought Competition Challenge.</p>
</div>
<p>The one-to-many matching task that is central to the competition throws up many challenges for researchers to wrestle with. Because IRI data contains food transactions collected from partnered retail establishments for over 350,000 items, the matchings need to be made based on limited data features, including categories, providers, and semantically inconsistent descriptions that consist of short phrases. Consider this hypothetical example: IRI product-related information about a (fictional) “Cheesy Hashbrowns Hamburger Helper, 5.5 Oz Box” needs to be linked to FNDDS nutrition-related information found under “Mixed dishes – meat, poultry, seafood: Mixed meat dishes”. Figure 2 demonstrates how the two databases are linked with each other to create the PPC. As can be seen, there is no common word that easily indicates that “Cheesy Hashbrowns Hamburger Helper…” should be matched with “Mixed dishes…”, and such cases exist in all IRI tables used for the challenge, from 2012 through 2018.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><a href="images/pt2-fig2.png"><img src="https://realworlddatascience.net/case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/images/pt2-fig2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="700"></a></p>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="figure-caption">
<p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Each universal product code (UPC) from the IRI data could match to only one ensemble code (EC) from the FNDDS data, whereas one EC code could match to multiple UPCs.</p>
</div>
<p>Also, because nutritionists or food scientists will always need to review the matching, regardless of the matching method used, it was important that our evaluation of proposed matching methods focused both on the accuracy of prediction models and also on metrics that would lead participants to develop models that facilitate qualified reviewers to reduce their workloads.</p>
<p>Organising the competition was also a challenge in its own right, for data privacy reasons. IRI scanner data contains sensitive information, such as store name, location, unit price, and weekly quantity sold for each item. This ruled out using existing online platforms like Kaggle, DrivenData or AIcrowd to host the competition, and instead required a private secure data enclave to ensure the safe use of sensitive and confidential data assets. The need for such an environment imposed capacity constraints on the competition, meaning only dozens of teams could be invited to take part, whereas on open platforms it is common to have thousands of teams competing and sharing ideas and code.</p>
<section id="competition-structure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competition-structure">Competition structure</h2>
<p>The competition ran over 10 months and consisted of three separate challenges: two interim, one final. Applications opened in September 2021, and the competition started in January 2022. Submission deadlines for the first and second interim challenges were in July and September 2022, respectively. For these rounds, participants submitted preliminary solutions for evaluation based solely on quantitative metrics, and two awards of $10,000 were given to the highest-scoring teams. The deadline for the final challenge was in October 2022. Here, solutions were evaluated by the scientific review board based on three judging criteria: quantitative metrics, transferability, and innovation. First, second, and third place winners received awards of $30,000, $1,500, and $1,000 respectively. Final presentations were given at the Food for Thought symposium in December 2022.</p>
<p>The competition was run entirely within the Coleridge Initiative’s Administrative Data Research Facility (ADRF), which was established by the United States Census Bureau to inform the decision-making of the Commission on Evidence-Based Policy under the Evidence Act. ADRF follows the Five Safes Framework: safe projects, safe people, safe data, safe settings, and safe outputs.</p>
<p>In keeping with this framework, participants were provided with ADRF login credentials after signing the relevant data use agreements during the onboarding process. All participants were required to agree to the ADRF terms of use, to complete security training, and to pass a security training assessment prior to accessing the challenge data. Participants’ access within ADRF was limited to the challenge environment and data only. There was no internet access, so Coleridge Initiative ensured that any packages requested by teams were available for use within the environment after passing security review. All codes and documentation were only allowed to be exported outside ADRF after export reviews from both Coleridge Initiative and USDA staff. At the end of each challenge, the teams submitted write-ups and supporting files by placing all the necessary submission files in their ADRF team folder. Detailed submission instructions are available via the <a href="https://github.com/realworlddatascience/realworlddatascience.github.io/tree/main/case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/_code">Real World Data Science GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<section id="metrics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Submissions were evaluated by Coleridge Initiative and technical review and subject review boards based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantitative metrics</strong> were used to measure the predictive accuracy and runtime of the model.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Transferability</strong> measured the quality of documentation and code, and the ability of individuals who are not involved in model development to replicate and implement the team’s approach.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong> measured novelty and creativity of the model in addressing the linkage problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical review was overseen by faculty members from computer science and engineering departments of top US universities. Subject review was handled by subject matter experts from USDA and Westat.</p>
<p>From a quantitative perspective, the most common way to evaluate machine learning competition submissions is to use model predictive accuracy. However, single metrics are typically incomplete descriptions of real-world tasks, and they can easily hide significant differences between models which simple predictive accuracy cannot capture. To select the most appropriate official challenge metrics, Coleridge Initiative reviewed the literature on the use of evaluation measures in both classification and ranking task machine learning competitions. Success at 5 (S@5) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 5 (NDCG@5) scores were ultimately used as the quantitative metrics.</p>
<p>The metrics were applied as follows: models proposed by each team were tasked with outputting five potential FNDDS matches for each IRI code, with potential FNDDS matches ordered from most likely to least likely. S@5 and NDCG@5 scores are broadly similar – both measure whether a correct match is present in the five proposed matches that participants were asked to identify. However, S@5 does not take rank position into account and only considers whether the five proposed FNDDS matches contain the correct FNDDS response. NDCG@5 does take rank into account and also measures how highly the correct FNDDS response is ranked among the five proposed matches. Both measures range from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%). Models get a “full credit” for S@5 as long as they contain the correct FNDDS option. NDCG@5 penalizes models when the correct match is ranked lower on the list of 5 proposed matches.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technical-description">Technical description</h2>
<section id="environment-setup" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="environment-setup">Environment setup</h5>
<p>Coleridge Initiative solicited technical requirements from participants at the challenge application stage to prepare the ADRF environment as much as possible before the competition began. Each team was asked to share anticipated workspace specifications and software library requests in their application package. From this we identified, reviewed, and installed the requested Python and R packages, libraries, and library components (e.g., pre-trained models, training data) that were not yet available within ADRF.</p>
<p>The setup of graphics processing units (GPUs) was also a critical part of competition preparation. We created an environment with 16 gibibyte (GiB) of GPU memory for each team. Our technology team met with multiple teams several times to discuss computing environment configurations to ensure the GPU could work properly. None of these efforts was wasted: without GPU access, it would be impossible for teams to use state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(BERT, Devlin et al. 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>We completed the setup of new team workspaces, each customized to the individual team’s resource and library requirements, including GPU configuration. The isolation and customization of workspaces was vital because teams may request different versions of libraries that potentially have version conflict with other libraries. We ensured the configurations were all set before the challenge began because such data challenges are bursty in nature <span class="citation" data-cites="macavaney_et_al_2021">(Macavaney et al. 2021)</span>, and handling support requests in the private data enclave risked causing delays. We hoped to avoid receiving too many requests in the beginning phase of the competition in order to give participants a better experience, though we did of course provide participants with instructions on how to request additional libraries during the challenge period.</p>
</section>
<section id="supporting-materials" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supporting-materials">Supporting materials</h5>
<p>In addition to environment preparation, we made available a list of supporting documentation, including IRI, PPC, and FNDDS codebooks, technical reports, and related publications that could help teams understand the challenge datasets. The FNDDS codebook pooled information on variable availability, coding, and descriptions across dataset files and years. It also included internal Westat food category coding difficulty ratings and notes on created PPC codes and provided UPC code, EC code, and general dataset remarks and observations that may take time for analysts to discover on their own.</p>
<p>We developed a baseline model to demonstrate the challenge task and the expected outputs – both outside of ADRF using FNDDS and fictitious data in place of IRI data, and an analogous model using FNDDS and IRI data within the ADRF secure environment. Moreover, we provided the teams with an evaluation script to read in their submissions and evaluate them for predictive accuracy against the public test set using S@5 and NDCG@5 challenge metrics. Finally, we held multiple webinars during the course of the challenge to explain next steps, address participant questions, solicit feedback, and provide general support. Multiple teams also met with our technology team to clarify ADRF-related questions or troubleshoot technical issues.</p>
<p>(Baseline model, toolkits, and evaluation script are available from the <a href="https://github.com/realworlddatascience/realworlddatascience.github.io/tree/main/case-studies/posts/2023/08/21/_code">Real World Data Science GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
</section>
<section id="data-splitting" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-splitting">Data splitting</h5>
<p>To mimic the real-world scenario, the competition used 2012–2016 IRI data as the training set, and the 2017–2018 IRI data as the test set, since the data change over time and USDA could provide the most recent data available. To make sure that models were generalizable and not just overfit to the test set, we split the test set into private and public test sets. In this way, we guaranteed that the models were evaluated on completely hidden data. In order to keep the similar distribution of the two sets, we first divided the data into five quintiles based on EC code frequencies and then randomly sampled 80% of records in each group without repetition for placement into the private test set. Later in the competition, because of the computation limit, we further shrank the private test set to 40% of its original size using the same data-splitting method.</p>
</section>
<section id="judging" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="judging">Judging</h5>
<p>In the first two rounds, submissions were evaluated based on the quantitative metrics, as previously mentioned above. Coleridge Initiative was responsible for running the evaluation script, making sure not to re-train the model or modify the configs in any way, and only applying the model to predict the private test set. Prediction results were then compared against ground truth to get the private scores.</p>
<p>The final challenge was reviewed by the scientific review board on all three judging criteria. Submitted models were first evaluated by Coleridge Initiative in the same way as in the first two rounds. The runtime of models was also recorded as an assessment of model cost. The scientific review boards then assessed the models by the quality of documentation, the quality of code, and the ability to replicate and implement the team’s approach, and scored the models for innovation and creativity in addressing the linkage problem. Lastly, scores were summarized and the scientific review board discussed and decided the winners of the competition.</p>

<section id="lessons-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>It was undoubtedly challenging for teams to work with highly secured data in a private data enclave for this data challenge. We solicited feedback from teams and summarized the issues that we experienced throughout the competitions, together with the solutions to resolve those issues. Below are our main lessons learned and we hope this summary can serve to inform future competitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environmental factors:</strong> The installation and setup of packages, libraries, and resources, as well as the configuration of GPUs, system dependencies, and workspace design were expected to take a long time as each team had their own needs. To accelerate the process, we requested a list of specific package and environment requirements from the teams in advance. However, due to the complexity of the system configuration required by the teams, environment setup took longer than expected. Thus, the challenge deadlines had to be postponed a few times to accommodate this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> Twelve teams were selected to participate in the challenge, but only three teams remained in the final challenge. Other than one team that was disqualified for violating the ADRF terms of use agreement, eight dropped out because of other commitments and insufficient time to meaningfully participate. To ensure security, ADRF does not allow jobs to run in the backend, which also adds to the time commitment of teams. To encourage teams to participate in the final challenge, we gave out additional awards for second and third places.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computing resource limit:</strong> One issue encountered in evaluating submitted models was computing environment resource limits due to the secured nature of the data enclave. The original private test dataset is four times larger than the public test dataset, making it unfeasible to evaluate. To overcome this issue, given the fixed resource constraints, we decided to reduce the private test set to 40% of its original size. It would have been helpful, though, if the competition had set a model running time limit at the outset, so that participants could build simpler yet effective models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supporting code:</strong> Although the initial baseline model we provided was extremely simple, we found this helped participants a lot in the initial phase – yet there is space to improve. To be specific, supporting codes should be constructed so that all relevant data tables are used and specify the main function to run the code, especially how the model should be tested. The teams only used the main table, which was the only table that was used in the baseline model, for training and did not touch the other supporting table. If we included the other table in the baseline model, it could help participants to have a better use of this data as well. In addition, a baseline model should be intuitive for the participants to follow, allowing evaluators to easily replace the public test set with the private test set without any programming modifications.</p></li>

<p>The Auburn Big Data team from Auburn University consists of five members, including three assistant professors: Dr Wenying Li of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, Dr Jingyi Zheng of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and Dr Shubhra Kanti Karmaker of the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering. Additionally, the team comprises two PhD students, Naman Bansal and Alex Knipper, who are affiliated with Dr Karmaker’s big data lab at Auburn University.</p>
<p>It is estimated that our team has spent approximately 1,400 hours on this project.</p>
<section id="our-perspective-on-the-challenge" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-perspective-on-the-challenge">Our perspective on the challenge</h2>
<p>At the start of this competition, we decided to test three general approaches, in the order listed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A heuristic approach, where we use only the data and a defined similarity metric to predict which FNDDS label a given IRI item should have.</p></li>
<li><p>A simpler modeling approach, where we train a simple statistical classifier, like a random forest <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1007/978-3-030-03146-6_86">(Parmar, Katariya, and Patel 2019)</span>, logistic regression, etc., to predict the FNDDS label for a given IRI item. For this method, we opted to use a random forest as our statistical model, as it was a simpler model to use as a baseline, having shown decent performance in a wide range of classification tasks. As it turned out, this approach was quite robust and accurate, so we kept it as our main model for this approach.</p></li>
<li><p>A large language modeling approach, where we train a model like BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(Devlin et al. 2018)</span> to map the descriptions for given IRI and FNDDS items to the FNDDS category the supplied IRI item belongs to.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="our-approach" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<p>As we explored the data provided, we opted to use the given 2017–2018 PPC dataset as our primary dataset for both training and testing. To ensure a fair evaluation of the model, we randomly split the dataset into 60% training samples and 40% testing samples, making sure our training process never sees the testing dataset. For evaluating our models, we adopted the competition’s metrics: Success@5 and NDCG@5. After months of testing, our statistical classifier (approach #2) proved itself to be the model that both processes the data fastest and achieves the highest performance on our testing metrics.</p>
<p>This approach, at a high level, takes in the provided data (among other configuration parameters), formats the data in a computer-readable format – converting the IRI and FNDDS descriptions to a numerical representation with word embeddings <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805 mikolov2013efficient pennington-etal-2014-glove">(2018; Mikolov et al. 2013; Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014)</span> and then using that numerical representation to calculate the distances between each description – and then trains a classification model (random forest <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1007/978-3-030-03146-6_86">(2019)</span>/neural network <span class="citation" data-cites="SCHMIDHUBER201585">(Schmidhuber 2015)</span>) that can predict an FNDDS label for a given IRI item.</p>
<p>In terms of data, our approach uses the FNDDS/IRI descriptions, combining them into a single “description” field, and the IRI item’s categorical items – department, aisle, category, product, brand, manufacturer, and parent company – to further discern between items.</p>
<p>While most industrial methods require use of a graphics processing unit (graphics card, or GPU) to perform this kind of processing, our primary method only requires the computer’s internal processor (CPU) to function properly. With that in mind, to achieve the best possible performance on our test metrics, the most time-consuming operations are run in parallel. The time taken to train our primary model can likely be further improved if we parallelize these operations across a GPU, with the only downside being the imposition of a GPU requirement for systems aiming to run this method.</p>
<p>In addition to our primary method, our team has worked with alternate approaches on the GPU (using BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(2018)</span>, neural networks <span class="citation" data-cites="SCHMIDHUBER201585">(2015)</span>, etc.) to either: 1) speed up the time it takes to process and make inferences for the data, achieving similar performance on our test metrics, or 2) achieve higher performance, likely at a cost to the time it takes to process everything. Our reasoning behind doing so is that if a simple statistical model performs well, then a larger language model should be able to demonstrate a higher performance on our test metrics without much of an increase in training time. At the current time, these methods are still unable to match the performance/efficiency tradeoff of our primary method.</p>
<p>After exploring alternate methods to no avail, our team then decided to focus again on our primary method, the random forest <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1007/978-3-030-03146-6_86">(2019)</span>, and a secondary method, feed-forward neural network mapping our input features (X) to the FNDDS labels (Y) <span class="citation" data-cites="SCHMIDHUBER201585">(2015)</span>, to optimize their training hyperparameters for the dataset. Our aim in this is to see which of our already-implemented, easier-to-run downstream methods would better optimize the performance/efficiency tradeoff after having its training parameters optimized to the fullest. This has resulted in a marginal increase in training time (+20-30 minutes) and a roughly 5% increase in performance for our still-highest performing model, the random forest.</p>
<p>Overall, our primary method – the random forest – gave us an approximate training time (including data pre-processing) of 4 hours 30 minutes for our ~38,000 IRI item training set, and an approximate inference time of 15 minutes on our testing set of ~15,000 IRI items. Furthermore, our method gave us a Success@5 score of .789 and an NDCG@5 score of .705 on our testing set.</p>
<section id="key-features" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-features">Key features</h5>
<p>Here is a list of the key features we utilize, along with what type of data we treat it as.</p>
<ul>
<li>FNDDS
<ul>
<li>food_code – identifier</li>
<li>main_food_description – text</li>
<li>additional_food_description – text</li>
<li>ingredient_description – text</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IRI
<ul>
<li>upc – identifier</li>
<li>upcdesc – text</li>
<li>dept – categorical</li>
<li>aisle – categorical</li>
<li>category – categorical</li>
<li>product – categorical</li>
<li>brand – categorical</li>
<li>manufacturer – categorical</li>
<li>parent – categorical</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The intuition behind using these particular features is that the text-based descriptions provide the majority of the “meaning” of the item. By converting each description to a numerical representation <span class="citation" data-cites="mikolov2013efficient pennington-etal-2014-glove">(2013; 2014)</span>, we can then calculate the similarity between each “meaning” to determine which FNDDS label is most similar to the IRI item provided. However, that alone is not enough. The categorical features on the IRI item help to further enhance the model’s classifications using the logic and categories people use in places like grocery stores. For example, if given an item whose aisle was “fruit” and brand was “Dole”, the item could be reasonably expected to be something like “peaches” over something like “broccoli”.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-selection" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-selection">Feature selection</h5>
<p>Aforementioned intuition aside, our feature selection was rather naive, in that we manually examined the data and removed any redundant text features before doing anything else. After that, we decided to use description fields as “text” data to comprise the main “meaning” of the item, represented numerically after converting the text using a word embedding <span class="citation" data-cites="mikolov2013efficient pennington-etal-2014-glove">(2013; 2014)</span>. We also decided to use the non-description fields (aisle, category, etc.) as “categorical” data that would be turned into its own numerical representation, allowing our model to more easily discern between items using similar systems to people.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-transformations" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-transformations">Feature transformations</h5>
<p>Our feature transformations are also relatively simple. First, we combine all description fields for each item to make one large description, and then use a word embedding method (like GloVe <span class="citation" data-cites="pennington-etal-2014-glove">(2014)</span> or BERT <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805">(2018)</span>) to convert the description into a numerical representation, resulting in a 300-dimensional GloVe or 768-dimensional BERT vector of numbers for each description. Then, for each IRI item, we calculate the cosine and Euclidean distances from each FNDDS item, resulting in two vectors, both equal in length to the original FNDDS data (in this case, two vectors of length ~7,300). The intuition behind this is that while cosine and Euclidean distances can tell us similar things, providing both of these sets of distances to the model should allow it to pick up on a more nuanced set of relationships between the IRI and FNDDS items.</p>
<p>For categorical data, we take all unique values in each field and assign them an ID number. While that is often not the best practice for making a numerical representation out of categorical data <span class="citation" data-cites="10.5120/ijca2017915495">(Potdar, Pardawala, and Pai 2017)</span>, it seemed to work for the downstream model.</p>
<p>Regardless, the aforementioned feature transformations give us (ad hoc) ~14,900 features if we use GloVe and ~15,300 features if we use BERT. Both feature sets can then be sent to the downstream random forest/neural network to start classifying items.</p>
<p>It should be noted that processing the data is by far the most time-consuming part of our method. The data processing times for each embedding are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>GloVe: ~3 hours</li>
<li>BERT: ~6 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to BERT both taking so long to process data and performing lower than our GloVe embeddings on the classification task, we opt to use GloVe embeddings for our primary method. Our only theoretical explanation here is that since BERT is better at context-dependent tasks <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1145/3443279.3443304">(Wang, Nulty, and Lillis 2021)</span>, it likely will expect something similar to well-structured sentences as input, which is not what the IRI/FNDDS descriptions are. Rather, GloVe – being a method that depends less on context <span class="citation" data-cites="mikolov2013efficient pennington-etal-2014-glove">(2013; 2014)</span> – should excel better when the input text is not a well-formed sentence.</p>
</section>
<section id="training-methods" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-methods">Training methods</h5>
<p>Once the data has been processed, we collect the following data for each IRI item:</p>
<ul>
<li>UPC code</li>
<li>Description (converted to numerical representation)</li>
<li>Categorical variables (converted to numerical representation)</li>
<li>Distances to each FNDDS item</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that has been collected for each IRI item, we can finally use our classification model. We initialize our model and begin the training process with the IRI data mentioned above and the target FNDDS labels for each one, so the model knows what the “correct” answer is for the given data. Once the model has trained on our training dataset, we save the model and it is ready for use.</p>
<p>This part of training takes much less time than preparing the data, since calculating the embeddings takes a lot more computation than a random forest model. The training times for each method are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random Forest: ~1 hour 15 minutes</li>
<li>Neural Network: ~25 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the neural network taking far less time to train than the random forest, it still scores lower on the scoring metrics than the random forest, so we opt to continue using the random forest model as our primary method.</p>

<section id="general-approach-to-developing-the-model" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-approach-to-developing-the-model">General approach to developing the model</h5>
<p>Since the linkage problem involves mapping tens of thousands of items to a smaller category set of a few thousand items, we decided to frame this problem as a multi-class classification problem <span class="citation" data-cites="aly2005survey">(Aly 2005)</span>, where we then rank the top “k” most probable class mappings, as requested by the competition ruleset.</p>
<p>Most of the usable data available to us is text data, so we need a method that can use that text-based information to accurately map classes based on the aforementioned text information. To best accomplish this, we opt to use word embedding techniques to calculate an average numerical representation for each text description (both IRI and FNDDS), so we can calculate distances between each description, giving our model a sense of how similar each description is.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-key-trick-to-the-model">The key “trick” to the model</h5>
<p>Since text descriptions hold the most information that can be used to link between an IRI item and an FNDDS item, finding a way to calculate the similarity between each description is paramount to making this method work.</p>
<p>Both distance calculation methods used in this work, cosine and Euclidean distance, are very similar in the type of information encoded, the only major difference being that cosine distance is implicitly normalized and Euclidean distance is not <span class="citation" data-cites="10.1145/967900.968151">(Qian et al. 2004)</span>.</p>

<p>Just by building the ranking using the cosine similarities between each IRI item and all FNDDS items, we can achieve a Success@5 performance of 0.234 and an NDCG@5 performance of 0.312. The other features are provided and the random forest classifier is used to add some extra discriminative power to the model.</p>

<section id="data-disclaimer" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-disclaimer">Data disclaimer</h5>
<p>Our current method only uses the data readily available from the 2017–2018 dataset, which we acknowledge is intended for testing. To remedy this, we further split this dataset into train/test sets and report results on our unseen test subset for our primary performance metrics. This gives a decent look into how the model will perform on unseen data.</p>

<p>Overall, our approximate training time for our primary method is 4 hours 30 minutes broken down (approximately) as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reading data from database: 30 seconds</li>
<li>Calculating ~7,300 FNDDS description embeddings: 15 minutes 45 seconds</li>
<li>Calculating ~38,000 IRI description embeddings and similarity scores: 2 hours 20 minutes 45 seconds</li>
<li>Formatting calculated data for the random forest classifier: 35 minutes</li>
<li>Training the random forest classifier: 1 hour 15 minutes</li>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="s5-ndcg5-performance">S@5 &amp; NDCG@5 performance</h5>
<p>This is how our best-performing model (GloVe + random forest) performs at the current time on the testing set:</p>
<ul>
<li>NDCG@5: 0.705</li>
<li>Success@5: 0.789</li>
</ul>
<p>When we evaluate that same model on the full PPC dataset we were provided (~38,000 items), we get the following scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>NDCG@5: 0.879</li>
<li>Success@5: 0.916</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: The full PPC dataset contains approximately 15,000 items that we used to train the model, so these scores are not as representative of our method’s performance as the previous scores.)</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, we only used the given 2017–2018 PPC dataset as our primary dataset for both training and testing. Going forward, we would like to include datasets from previous years as well, which we believe would further increase our model performance. Additionally, the datasets generated from this research have the potential to inform and support additional studies from a variety of perspectives, including nutrition, consumer research, and public health. Further research utilizing these datasets has the potential to make significant contributions to our understanding of consumer behavior and the role of food and nutrient consumption in overall health and well-being.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>It was interesting that the random forest model performed better than the vanilla neural network model. This shows that a simple solution can work better, depending on the application. This observation is in line with the well-established principle in machine learning that the choice of model should be guided by the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the data. In this case, the random forest model, being a simpler and more interpretable model, was better suited to the problem at hand and was able to outperform the more complex neural network model. These results underscore the importance of careful model selection and the need to consider both the complexity of the model and the specific requirements of the problem when choosing an algorithm for a particular application.</p>
